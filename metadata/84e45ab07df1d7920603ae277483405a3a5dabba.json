This has beentested on the following operating \nsystems: Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP3.\n\nFile Size After Extraction: 576 MB\n\n\nWhen it asks for the code that's on the back of the CD case, type the\nfollowing (without the quotation marks): &quot;14103 BUZZ WEIR VISA STAR&quot;\n\nUse ImgBurn, Infrarecorder, etc to write this to a blank CD. An alternatve to \ndoing that would be to use Daemon to create a virtual CD drive.\n\nNote: When using XP, you were able to play the game, but not save the game,\neven if compatibility mode was enabled. This led me to assume that the game\nwon't even work in Vista or 7.\n\nNote: You need a 3D video card to play this. I was unable to test if fullly on\nWindows 2000 because of my video card limitations.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84e45ab07df1d7920603ae277483405a3a5dabba","amp;dn":"EA+Sports+Triple+Play+2001+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84e45ab07df1d7920603ae277483405a3a5dabba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,228,90,176,125,241,215,146,6,3,174,39,116,131,64,90,58,93,171,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
