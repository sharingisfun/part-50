Her younger brother, a priest, holds her responsible. Fifteen       \n    years later Bob manipulates a clingy, drippy Cathy into falling in       \n    love with him. He lures her back to the apartment building of her        \n    youth for a so-called work party. There, he and his business partner     \n    Monica and a few of their oddly pathetic friends hold Cathy hostage      \n    for a few hours before forcing her off the side of the building roof.    \n    She becomes one of them, a 'lurker'. The building is supposed to be      \n    'hell' and everyone born there is evil and is brought back there to      \n    die. Cathy becomes one of the lurkers who floats around town warning     \n    other people who the baddies try to get back to the building - Bobs      \n    new girlfriend and Cathys priest brother including.                      \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
