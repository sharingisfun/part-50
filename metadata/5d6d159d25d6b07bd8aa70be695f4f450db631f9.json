In Lockdown, Rainbow is pitted against a worldwide terrorist organization known as the Global Liberation Front, comprised of various leftist, anarchist, and third-world organizations opposed to the West. The Global Liberation Front has stolen a man-made nanotech virus named &quot;Legion&quot;. &quot;Legion&quot; is a nanite aerosol that causes massive hemorrhaging in its victim and has a mortality rate of 100%. Rainbow must find and stop the GLF from using the virus. To accomplish this, Rainbow goes from country to country, tracking down each country's GLF cell, and finally capturing or killing that cell's leader, ultimately leading to a showdown with the GLF's supreme leader, Bastian Vanderwaal. A major plot twist occurs when team sniper, Dieter Weber, is captured by the terrorists, prompting an unauthorized rescue effort by the team.
