Zeroing in on the strategic decisions of both major parties, the directors, James D. Stern and Adam Del Deo, illuminate not only the putative blunders of the Kerry-Edwards campaign but also the larger difficulties of the Democratic Party itself. ItÃƒÂ¢??s not pretty, but it is instructive.\n\nÃƒÂ¢??Facing in President Bush an incumbent burdened by a 48 percent approval rating and an unpopular war in Iraq, Senator John Kerry had ÃƒÂ¢??probably 20 different ways he could have won,ÃƒÂ¢?? says the former Clinton adviser Paul Begala. ÃƒÂ¢??And he refused to execute on any of them.ÃƒÂ¢??\nInstead, the campaign is shown juggling multiple messages and lacking a cohesive field strategy. (One particularly painful sequence for Democrats contrasts the door-to-door efforts of volunteers from both camps.) Fatally ignoring both the accusations of the Swift Boat Veterans and the concerns of so-called values voters, Senator Kerry watches as his every misstep is recycled into a Republican attack ad.\n\nÃƒÂ¢??Meanwhile, over at the Bush-Cheney campaign, Republicans are fashioning a clear message of steadfastness versus ÃƒÂ¢??flip-floppingÃƒÂ¢?? and repeating it with terrifying efficiency. Backed by Reaganesque images of the president chopping wood on his Texas ranch, the campaign cannily exploits fears of terrorism and same-sex marriage to encourage ÃƒÂ¢??passive RepublicansÃƒÂ¢?? to join the cause. They do, and the rest is history. But instead of assuming a fetal position, Democrats might consider ÃƒÂ¢??... So Goes the NationÃƒÂ¢?? less as the opening of an old wound and more as a manual for 2008.ÃƒÂ¢??\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 730,482,688 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 01:30:35 (130303 frames)\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 608x336 () [=] [=1.810]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 933 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.190 bpp\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 133 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 42 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078c4364a69f18e6a2b63a30724d536b7755b938","amp;dn":"...So+Goes+the+Nation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078c4364a69f18e6a2b63a30724d536b7755b938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,140,67,100,166,159,24,230,162,182,58,48,114,77,83,107,119,85,185,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
