On Born for You, she tackles plenty of cabaret favorites that focus on the theme of lasting love. With influences that range from jazz (&quot;Moondance&quot;) to classical (&quot;On My Way to You&quot;), Lee does her best to liven up these well-worn standards with her smooth-as-silk voice. &quot;Circle Game&quot; and &quot;Only My Pillow Knows&quot; feature subtle contributions from Dolly Parton, &quot;Child in Me&quot; employs a children's chorus, and a string section accompanies Lee on the title track. Unfortunately, many new listeners will find Lee's impeccable tone on these songs monotonous and disappointing. --Jason Verlinde","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d9e1d89ae75d59c7242ae1e6230f6553cc6a72c","amp;dn":"Kathie+Lee+Gifford+-+Born+For+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d9e1d89ae75d59c7242ae1e6230f6553cc6a72c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,158,29,137,174,117,213,156,114,66,174,30,98,48,246,85,60,198,167,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
