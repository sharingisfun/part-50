It was founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982.[2] The newspaper vies with The Wall Street Journal for the position of having the widest circulation of any newspaper in the United States, something it had previously held since 2003. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the paper has 1.8 million copies as of March 2012[1] compared with The Wall Street Journal's 2.1 million[1] though this figure includes the WSJ's 400,000 paid-for, online subscribers. USA Today remains the widest circulated print newspaper in the United States. USA Today is distributed in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, Canada and the United Kingdom. The newspaper has its headquarters in the Tysons Corner area of Fairfax County, Virginia.[3] USA Today sells for US$2 in newsstands, although it is often found free at hotels and airports that distribute it to their customers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f10129e20353538278aa21d11ee2f49c6d7ff2","amp;dn":"USA_TODAY_22-24.11.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f10129e20353538278aa21d11ee2f49c6d7ff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,241,1,41,226,3,83,83,130,120,170,33,209,30,226,244,156,109,127,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
