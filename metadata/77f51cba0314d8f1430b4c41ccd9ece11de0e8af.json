After her husband departs for a foreign scholarship, Bogna learns that her mother died. The trip to her hometown for the funeral becomes a voyage in time, during which she relives the memories of her idyllic childhood. \nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬As beautifully mounted as any of Szulkin's films, it's full of delirious wide-angle imagery (at times recalling the films of Terry Gilliam). Unavailable on DVD even in Poland, this is a most unfairly neglected work by Szulkin.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f51cba0314d8f1430b4c41ccd9ece11de0e8af","amp;dn":"%E5%A5%B3%E6%80%A7%E6%AC%B2%E9%AB%94%2FFemina%281991%29TVRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f51cba0314d8f1430b4c41ccd9ece11de0e8af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,245,28,186,3,20,216,241,67,11,76,65,204,217,236,225,29,224,232,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
