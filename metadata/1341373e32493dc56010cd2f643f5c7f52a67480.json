Jesse&amp;#039;s a wanted man, living under a pseudonym, carrying out a train robbery, disappearing to Kentucky, and reappearing to plan a bank holdup with Robert and Robert&amp;#039;s brother as his team. The rest of the gang is dead, arrested, or gone from Missouri. Whenever Jesse&amp;#039;s around, there&amp;#039;s tension: he&amp;#039;s murderous, quixotic, depressed, and cautious. Ford wants to be somebody and wants the reward. On April 3, 1882, things come to a head: Jesse is 34, Robert 20. Ford becomes famous, reenacting the shooting on stage, facing down the label &quot;coward,&quot; shot dead in 1892.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1341373e32493dc56010cd2f643f5c7f52a67480","amp;dn":"The.Assassination.of.Jesse.James.2007.Swesub.DVDRip-EXTREM-E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1341373e32493dc56010cd2f643f5c7f52a67480","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,65,55,62,50,73,61,197,96,16,205,47,100,63,92,127,82,166,116,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
