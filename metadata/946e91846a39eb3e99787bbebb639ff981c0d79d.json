Opus is downhearted because as a mere penguin he is denied the ability to fly. He longs to be able to soar in the air with the other birds, and his heart grows cold with the reality that he can&amp;#039;t. Even the pigeons look down upon Opus, so Opus decides that one way or another he will learn how to fly. He orders a machine off the TV, and assembles it (maybe not correctly, the directions were in a different language). When it comes time to test the machine by jumping off a three mile high cliff, Opus decides to do something less dangerous, and goes home to make anchovy Christmas cookies. He doesn&amp;#039;t give up on his dream though, and makes a Christmas wish to Santa for &quot;wings that will go!&quot;. Happily for Opus, his dream of flying comes true, though not quite in the manner he expected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:946e91846a39eb3e99787bbebb639ff981c0d79d","amp;dn":"A+Wish+for+Wings+that+Work+%28Re-Up%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"946e91846a39eb3e99787bbebb639ff981c0d79d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,110,145,132,106,57,235,62,153,120,123,190,187,99,159,249,129,192,215,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
