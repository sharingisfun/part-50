He and his team of medical doctors try to cure very ill ordinary people in the United States of America.\n\n\n--- The episode --------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo babies in separate delivery rooms delivered by separate staff become deathly ill within minutes of birth. Even though there&amp;#039;s no way to explain how an infection could spread between them so quickly, the team must find some way to prevent an epidemic they can&amp;#039;t yet identify. In chasing the killer, House must make a choice: give both babies the same treatment and loose both if he&amp;#039;s wrong, or give them separate treatments to assure a positive ID of the illness, but also assuring that one of the babies will die.\n\n\n--- info ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\naudio codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3, 48000Hz  122 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo LAME3.90.\n\ncideo codec: XviD 1.0.2\n\nresolution: 624 x 352 pix\n\nsize: 349 MB (or 357,562 KB or 366,143,488 bytes)\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0606030/\n\nOriginal Air Date: 7 December 2004 (Season 1, Episode 4)\n\n\n--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all, I didn&amp;#039;t make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. \nBut with a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or \nrarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. \nSo I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.\n\nThere will probably be more....\n\n\n__Razer__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cefa970622d113b01929763369b867429c2fee9","amp;dn":"House+MD+-+104+-+Maternity.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cefa970622d113b01929763369b867429c2fee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,239,169,112,98,45,17,59,1,146,151,99,54,155,134,116,41,194,254,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
