Again Promo Only North America let the side down with wrong ratio settings and often the Wide Screen original ends up at 4:3 which really is so stupid.\n\nWhy not let the backward CRT owners put up with the letterbox format and just distribute music video's in Wide Screen 16:9 Ratio and stop messing us VJ's about Eh????\n\nJust as well OtsAV Pro (the Worlds Best Video/Karaoke Discotheque software) looks after the screen Ratio's pretty well despite the backward North American branch of Promo Only sigh...\n\nSource Promo Only DVD9 Ripped with DVD Decrypter using file split by Cell ID mode and each file re named using industry conventions.\n\nVOB (mpeg2) files\nMixed Screen Ratio (sigh)\n320kps Audio\n\nEnjoy.
