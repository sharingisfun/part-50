As the frowsy wife of Bronx cabdriver Ernest Borgnine, Davis insists that her daughter Debbie Reynolds have a high-class wedding--caterers and all. Reynolds and future hubby Rod Taylor want a simple ceremony, but Davis' mind is made up. The wedding snowballs into an unwieldy affair as Davis and Borgnine find that they must invite everyone they know or risk incurring the wrath of their neighborhood. When the cost of the affair exceeds the family's bank account, Davis rails at Borgnine for failing to be a good provider. It takes her till the very end of the film to realize what a fool she's been. Gore Vidal, of all people, adapted The Catered Affair from a TV drama written by Paddy Chayefsky; the original telecast had starred Thelma Ritter. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049061/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049061/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nSpanish  subs:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3176793/the-catered-affair-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3176793/the-catered-affair-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector: Richard Brooks\n\n\n\n\n        Bette Davis\t ... \tMrs. Agnes Hurley\n\n\tErnest Borgnine\t... \tTom Hurley\n\n\tDebbie Reynolds\t... \tJane Hurley\n\tBarry Fitzgerald\t... \tUncle Jack Conlon\n\tRod Taylor\t... \tRalph Halloran\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:33:29\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x480  1.50:1\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1214 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,12 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9d3d9f5ca33e79091bb32c3d482ff5b6e7a6e6","amp;dn":"The+Catered+Affair+%281956%29+Bette+Davis++Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9d3d9f5ca33e79091bb32c3d482ff5b6e7a6e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,157,61,159,92,163,62,121,9,27,179,44,61,72,47,245,182,231,166,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
