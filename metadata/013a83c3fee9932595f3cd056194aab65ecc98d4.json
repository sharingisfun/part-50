This time he's been behind the wheel of an Aston Martin DBS, Pagani Zonda F Roadster, McLaren SLR 722 GTR, and Porsche 911 Turbo to name a few. We know it might feel a bit like the Jeremy Clarkson Gawker Stalker around here as of late, with Jezza ranting on the CTS-V and ZR1, being spotted in Vietnam and on a scooter, and crashing head-on into things. You may be right. Mostly because love him or hate him, he's entertaining\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013a83c3fee9932595f3cd056194aab65ecc98d4","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Clarkson.2008.Thriller.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013a83c3fee9932595f3cd056194aab65ecc98d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,58,131,195,254,233,147,37,149,243,205,5,97,148,170,182,94,204,152,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
