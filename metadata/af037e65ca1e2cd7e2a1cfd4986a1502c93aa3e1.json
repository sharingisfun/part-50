Bob Harris from BBC Radio 2 stumbled across Idgy during the recording process and immediately began airing her songs across Great Britain and Europe. It garnered an amazing critical response in Great Britain and the U.S., as well as nominations for Album of the Year, Producer of the Year for Paul Pearcy, and Best New Band at the 2006 Austin Music Awards.\n\nThe album spent 11 weeks on the national Americana chart, with the unique distinction of being the only self-released record on the chart at the time. National Public Radio made ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGood EnoughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ their Song of the Day. ORIGIN STORY was on the much-coveted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbest of the yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ lists by Austin NPR affiliate KUTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s David Brown, the Austin ChronicleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longtime music writer Margaret Moser, and many, many others. Through the kind words of all these strangers, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been winning over fans in Texas, across America and around the world.\n\nIdgy has opened for music icons Kris Kristofferson and Richard Thompson, as well as great artists like Jimmy Webb, Leo Kottke, Billy Joe Shaver, Joe Ely, Mary Gauthier, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Kelly Willis, David Bromberg, and the Derailers. Idgy tours nationally, often accompanied by guitarist Will Sexton.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/23/idgy-vaughn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/23/idgy-vaughn/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af037e65ca1e2cd7e2a1cfd4986a1502c93aa3e1","amp;dn":"Idgy+Vaughn...Origin+Story%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af037e65ca1e2cd7e2a1cfd4986a1502c93aa3e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,3,126,101,202,30,44,215,226,161,207,212,152,106,21,2,201,58,163,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
