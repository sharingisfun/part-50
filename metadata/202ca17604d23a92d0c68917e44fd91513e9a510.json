This third-person action game immerses players in the world of Tony Stark -- the brilliant industrialist and inventor who both created and became the world&amp;#039;s toughest hero - Iron Man. By customizing the advanced technology in Iron Man&amp;#039;s suits, gamers can take advantage of a wide array of high-impact weapons to strategically blow-up and destroy any enemy force and fight to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.\nMINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS :\n* OS: Windows 2000/XP/Vista\n* Processor: Pentium 4 @ 1.4 GHz or Equivalent\n* Memory: 512 MB\n* Video Memory: 256 MB\nRecommended system requirements:\n* OS: Windows XP or Vista\n* Processor: 2.6 + GHz Intel or 2.4 + GHz AMD\n* Memory: 2 GB RAM\n* Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 7900 GTX or higher; ATI X1800 XL series or higher\n* Hard Drive Space: 12 GB\n* Sound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card and drivers - 5.1 sound card recommended\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nKnown issues:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; wav2raw.exe is seen as an exploit by chatty antivirus softwares\nalthough it is a command line audio decompressor. This file\nis an essential tool and the sound in the game will not work\nif this tool does not extract the sound files correctly.\nThis file doesnGÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t harm your PC in any way.\nI have scanned my whole PC with AVG and Kaspersky before and\nafter (not during) extracting these files, and there was no\nsign of threat.\n\n&gt; Takes painfully long with Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS)\nrunning as opposed to Norton 360. I think KIS scans each and\nevery file before execution.\n\n&gt; At this moment, the known trouble maker is Kaspersky. Neither\nAVG nor Norton see wav2raw.exe as a threat.\n\n&gt; If you are too paranoid, possible way to extract this game,\nkeeping peace of mind, would be to disconnect from the internet,\ndisable Kaspersky or similar chatty antivirus softwares,\ninstall the game, scan PC with your favorite antivirus software,\nresume everything. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:202ca17604d23a92d0c68917e44fd91513e9a510","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+2008+%28Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"202ca17604d23a92d0c68917e44fd91513e9a510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,44,161,118,4,210,58,146,208,198,137,23,228,79,217,21,19,233,165,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
