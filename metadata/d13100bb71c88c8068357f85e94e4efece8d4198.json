It\\&amp;#039;s thought provoking. Really, so many of the decisions made are poor, so many of the characters do fairly rancid things. But you can\\&amp;#039;t help loving them and you can\\&amp;#039;t help loving the plots. I\\&amp;#039;ve fallen in love with every member of the Botwin family. This is a smart, very funny, sexy and sophisticated show. I\\&amp;#039;m not going to summarize anything here because I\\&amp;#039;m sure people are aware of the premise.\n\nIt sounds like it could be ho-hum, but you must see it- each episode, people are dealing the characters deal with difficult decisions. Sometimes there\\&amp;#039;s deliberation, sometimes there\\&amp;#039;s regret- the show\\&amp;#039;s smart enough where it assumes we know what the \\&quot;right thing\\&quot; was that one should have done. Most often, the characters don\\&amp;#039;t do that right thing, and yet we love them, maybe even think \\&quot;I would have done that.\\&quot; This is a show that basically says, beneath the normalcy, everyone is pushed to the limit in some way. It\\&amp;#039;s no where near as dark as \\&quot;Twin Peaks,\\&quot; but somehow, without the freakiness/fear, it reminds me of it because it\\&amp;#039;s intelligent and it shows what lies beneath a bit.\n\nWhen you watch it, watch out for Shane Botwin who is the Id of the show, and Andy, his grown up version who I personally hate yet am totally charmed by.\n\nAh, and yes, the acting is superb.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d13100bb71c88c8068357f85e94e4efece8d4198","amp;dn":"Weeds+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d13100bb71c88c8068357f85e94e4efece8d4198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,49,0,187,113,200,140,128,104,53,127,133,233,78,78,254,206,141,65,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
