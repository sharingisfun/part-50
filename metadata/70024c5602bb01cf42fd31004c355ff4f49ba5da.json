Great show, great setlist, wild audience, superb recording.

And no prizes for guessing my favourite era for the band... If only the professionally recorded 1977 Sydney Bondi Lifesaver gig were to show up...\n#5 has little in the way of audible crowd response, and the 1979 shows I find more predictable, and with &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, they&amp;#039;d lost their original rawness/bluesiness and were better as a studio band.\n\nAngus Young\nMalcolm Young\nBon Scott\nPhil Rudd\nCliff Williams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70024c5602bb01cf42fd31004c355ff4f49ba5da","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Live+1977-08-22+Cleveland%2C+Agora+Ballroom+%28Burning+Balls%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70024c5602bb01cf42fd31004c355ff4f49ba5da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,2,76,86,2,187,1,207,66,253,49,0,76,53,95,244,244,155,165,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
