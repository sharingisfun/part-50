It's Kevin Eldon.\n\n What other show on TV would bring you a song and dance number, The Incredible Moose Human, The Great Spagboletti, A Fictional Northern Man, John Lennon's Head, The Perspective Twins, some performance poetry, Wendy Wilson's White Coat Window On The World Of World Wide Wonders, a sketch with a doctor in it and Hitler, and still not be halfway through the first episode?\n\n That was a rhetorical question.\n\n Kevin Eldon's list of credits includes many of the finest and best loved comedies of the last 20 years, including: Big Train, Brass Eye, I'm Alan Partridge, Smack The Pony, Nighty Night, Hot Fuzz, Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, How TV Ruined Your Life, Four Lions, This Is Jinsy, Arthur Christmas, Hunderby and plenty more.\n\n Commissioner Cheryl Taylor said: &quot;Kevin Eldon is a very special comedian indeed and we're delighted to have the opportunity to showcase his many talents on BBC Two.&quot;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/its_kevin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/its_kevin/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 350 MiB\nDuration                                 : 27mn 44s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 657 Kbps\n\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 27mn 44s\nBit rate                                 : 1 763 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3c36c7387c111b1223f2bfe9c3464e5032b5f71","amp;dn":"BBC+-+It%27s+Kevin+-+Series+01+-+TVrip+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3c36c7387c111b1223f2bfe9c3464e5032b5f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,195,108,115,135,193,17,177,34,63,43,254,156,52,100,229,3,43,95,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
