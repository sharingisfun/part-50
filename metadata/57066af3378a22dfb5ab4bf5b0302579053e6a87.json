Of course if you want to defrag the whole drive Defraggler will let you do that too.\n\nCompact and Portable\n\nDefraggler was written in the same compact architecture as other Piriform products (CCleaner and Recuva). This results in a compact single EXE application, which can be copied to a thumbdrive and then used whenever you need it, without a complex installation process. The EXE itself is less than 1MB!\n\nVista Support\n\nDefraggler supports all OSs released since Windows 2000, this includes Windows 2000, 2003, XP and Vista. 64-bit support has also just been added!\nAdditionally Defraggler supports both NTFS and FAT32 file systems.\n\nLocate Files on the Drive\n\nAfter analysis Defraggler lists all the fragmented files on the drive.\nSelecting one or many will highlight their location on the disk.\nAllowing you to visually see the location of files on the disk.\n\nFreeware\n\nWhy pay hundreds of dollars for a commercial defragmentation tool, when you can use Defraggler for free! This includes corporate use as well!\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv1.10.143\n\n\nAdded file exclusion feature.\n\nAdded detection of Solid State Drives.\n\nAdded &quot;Include non-fragmented files&quot; checkbox to file search.\n\nImproved interactivity of search.\n\nFixed problem that could allow df.exe and Defraggler.exe to run at the same time.\n\nFixed rare crash while reanalyzing.\n\nMinor GUI text changes.\n\nMinor bug fixes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57066af3378a22dfb5ab4bf5b0302579053e6a87","amp;dn":"Defraggler+1.10.143+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57066af3378a22dfb5ab4bf5b0302579053e6a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,6,106,243,55,138,34,223,181,171,75,245,176,48,37,121,5,62,106,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
