In this entertaining collection, she plays freely and on a very large scale, just what gypsy music requires. It may not take much intellect to play Waxman's Carmen Fantasy (I like Sarasate's better, anyway). But it does take intellect, and lots more, to play BartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³k's Second Rhapsody as convincingly as she does here, with the very assertive collaboration of Ilan Rechtman. St. John doesn't make the difficulties of Ravel and Sarasate sound easy, but both musicians play with such flair it doesn't matter. Rechtman's gypsy arrangements are goofy and enjoyable. Wide-range sound.\n\nMP3 file (192Kbps)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcf1b49d783e2faa5e484460e48a7622b2e1cfb2","amp;dn":"Gypsy+%28Lara+St.+John%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcf1b49d783e2faa5e484460e48a7622b2e1cfb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,241,180,157,120,62,47,170,94,72,68,96,228,138,118,34,178,225,207,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
