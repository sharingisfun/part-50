This episode never will be released as MP4, size gain is this time too small (approx. 54MB) and making a duplicate would make no sense.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11dcb28f3bcb1e91defa171adc7adaee007f1799","amp;dn":"Spartacus.Blood.and.Sand.S01E07.HDTV.XviD%5Bmicro%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11dcb28f3bcb1e91defa171adc7adaee007f1799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,220,178,143,59,203,30,145,222,250,23,26,220,122,218,238,0,127,23,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
