He agrees to participate in the charade, but with a few conditions of his own.\n\nThe unlikely couple heads to Alaska to meet his quirky family (MARY STEENBURGEN, CRAIG T. NELSON, BETTY WHITE)\n and the always-in-control city girl finds herself in one comedic fish-out-of-water situation after another.\n\nWith an impromptu wedding in the works and an immigration official on their tails, Margaret and Andrew reluctantly\n vow to stick to the plan despite the precarious consequences.\n\n                    \n\n                                            NOTEs\n                                         ---------------\n\nNot the greatest of CAMs , almost seems to be 2 sources . Most of the picture looks OK , but theres spots \nwhere it goes all fuzzyand then theres some flicker....Was hoping for better :( \nBTW , nope the END CREDITS arent here :( ,I know ... but if we do get them I do have the audio :)\nWith all the twits (audience interaction) in this source , and all the laff'n in the english CAM .. I dont know how you watched the others.\nYou still gotta put up with the twits , but the audio is good and direct. \nYou guys need to remember, Im just starting out on this stuff , got alot to learn . Long ways to go with the video,\nhell I may not even get there. But of course the audio is your to use as you please . Full original copies are available .\nIf you know me , you know where they are.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c525d543a70941387bcef8b7a571d7c8211d4318","amp;dn":"The+Proposal+TS+XviD-Fatal+%2ANoRar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c525d543a70941387bcef8b7a571d7c8211d4318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,37,213,67,167,9,65,56,123,206,248,183,165,113,215,200,33,29,67,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
