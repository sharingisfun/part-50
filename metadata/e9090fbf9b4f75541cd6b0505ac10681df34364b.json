It was conceived summer of 2004 and has gained a strong reputation as one of the most brutal EBM acts in europe.\n\nAlthough often compared to other bands under the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Terror EBMÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ flag, CDG brings other elements into the music that not many other acts do. Rooted in classical, metal, trance, and a whole array of other styles of ear candy, CDG promises to take its music to new, unexplored territories.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9090fbf9b4f75541cd6b0505ac10681df34364b","amp;dn":"CeDigest+-+Walking+In+The+Flesh+%282010%29+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9090fbf9b4f75541cd6b0505ac10681df34364b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,9,15,191,155,79,117,84,28,214,176,80,90,193,6,129,223,52,54,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
