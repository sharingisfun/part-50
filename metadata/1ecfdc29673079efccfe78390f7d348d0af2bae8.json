Directed by Sutherland and produced by Ana\n                  Lombardo, Pedal the documentary lets viewers live the\n                 spectacle of the delivery itself.\n\n\n\n        Extras\n        Extra Footage\n\n\n\n\nThe DVD: \n\nThis film is an insider's look at the life, lifestyle and hardships of the New York City Bike Messenger. It shows a life of trying to support a family on a shoe string, and occasionally watching that shoestring snap, a life sorting out the the issues of destitution, substance abuse, and injury - all without health care, and ultimately, a life with little hope. It illuminates the brotherhood of messengers which remains the only support for those who are part of this world. For most of them, it is all that they need. Living and dying by the clock for the mere pocket change they earn and upon which to get by, the messengers have their own way of blowing off steam. PEDAL catches these messengers running Alleycat Races. Alleycats are adrenaline fueled rampages through NYC's busy streets via the fastest way possible. In defiance of the system that they feel holds them down, they forge headlong down city streets narrowly squeezing between busses, darting through red lights within a whisker's breadth of demise. Peter Sutherland catches all of this in first person footage that makes a viewer's stomach wince and sphincter pucker in discomfort at the mere sight of the action. In a very personal and sensitive way, PEDAL captures this lifestyle in a crystalline form. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ecfdc29673079efccfe78390f7d348d0af2bae8","amp;dn":"Pedal.2001.COMPLETE.NTSC.DVDR-OvE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ecfdc29673079efccfe78390f7d348d0af2bae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,207,220,41,103,48,121,239,204,254,120,57,15,125,52,141,10,242,186,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
