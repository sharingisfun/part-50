Pre-school students have been outfitted with jerseys carrying tiny computer chips that have a radio antenna that can be tracked from a distance.

In 1979, Carter installed solar panels on the roof of the West Wing as part of a new solar strategy. They were removed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and put into storage. In 1990, the panels were brought to Unity College in Maine. The students are now hoping to convince President Obama to reinstall the panel back on the White House roof.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e67064112e9cae7f9a95f460665273a695583f","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+09+sep+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e67064112e9cae7f9a95f460665273a695583f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,230,112,100,17,46,156,174,127,154,149,244,96,102,82,115,166,149,88,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
