You may use the software of your choice, I'll leave that up to you. \n\nHowever, if you'd like to watch it on your computer, most software that plays DVDs will play these files. \n\nI hope you enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f74aa8fb1d689ebb80216d77fca6f999bc8c24c","amp;dn":"Death+Note+Volume+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f74aa8fb1d689ebb80216d77fca6f999bc8c24c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,116,170,143,177,214,137,235,184,2,22,215,127,202,111,153,155,200,194,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
