Only if a proposal or prototype looks realistic and professional, the target audience will be convinced of their merits. \nDOSCH Textures: Industrial Design V3 contains more than 300 high-resolution texture layers which can be combined to realistic looking surfaces. Use them for design and visualization projects in the industrial field, for product depictions and for material-related effects. All textures are seamless tileable. \nThe materials in this texture library include: \nsynthetics, wood, nylon fabric, carbon / fiber glas, leather, varnished surfaces, rubber, glass (structure and plain), paper, brushed metals and more. \nThe high-resolution multi-layer textures include all relevant shader-maps for the material properties like the color-map and the bump-map. They render surfaces with a very realistic appearance and look. \nIt is especially because of the high resolution (at least 1024x1024 pixel - most have 2048x2048 pixel) and the inherent high degree of detail, that these textures are &quot;a must&quot; for any serious 3D-designer. All texture layers can directly be used in most 3D-animation and CAD applications. \nThe textures are provided in the JPEG-format with the highest quality-settings. \nAll textures are license-free and can therefore be used without any additional cost in all * commercial productions. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/laOBkAaCi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/laOBkAaCi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-- please keep seeding --","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b988b10b9a8a5ab5f3507a0a72b40629e7a8d7d5","amp;dn":"Stock+Photo+-+Industrial+Design+V3+Texture+Pack+Dosch+HQ+JPEG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b988b10b9a8a5ab5f3507a0a72b40629e7a8d7d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,136,177,11,154,138,90,181,243,80,122,10,114,180,6,41,231,168,215,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
