All four defendants were accused of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“assisting in making copyright content availableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Peter Sunde: Guilty. Fredrik Neij: Guilty. Gottfrid Svartholm: Guilty. \n\nCarl LundstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m: Guilty. The four receive 1 year in jail each and fines totaling $3,620,000.\n\nWhile only a few weeks ago, it seems like an eternity since the trial of The Pirate Bay Four ended and the court retired to consider its verdict. The prosecution claimed that the four defendants were ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“assisting in making copyright \n\ncontent availableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and demanded millions of dollars in damages. The defense did not agree, and all pleaded not guilty - backed up by the inimitable King Kong defense.\n\nToday, Friday April 17, the court issued its decision: article continuously updated\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe court has found that by using Pirate BayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s services there has been file-sharing of music, films and computer games to the extent the prosecutor has stated in his case,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ said the district court. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis file-sharing constitutes an \n\nunlawful transfer to the public of copyrighted performances.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nPeter Sunde (born September 13, 1978) alias ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“brokepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢:\n\nVerdict: Guilty - 1 year in prison, damages to pay: $905,000\n\nPeter Althin, brokepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lawyer said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI spoke to Peter and he wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t very surprised. A journalist heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d spoken to knew an hour before it was public that all four would be convicted. The verdict was leaked from the court. I have to think \n\nabout what effects that can have on the sentence. It is unacceptable that the court is leaking.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nFredrik Neij (born April 27, 1978) alias ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“TiAMOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢:\n\nVerdict: Guilty - 1 year in prison, damages to pay: $905,000\n\nSimilar to the other defendants, Fredrik Neij was not present to hear the verdict. He currently lives in Thailand from where he manages The Pirate BayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s servers.\n\n\nGottfrid Svartholm (October 17, 1984) alias ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AnakataÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢:\n\nVerdict: Guilty - 1 year in prison, damages to pay: $905,000\n\nAnakataÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lawyer Ola Salomonsson said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re appealing. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very surprising that the court has chosen to treat the accused as a team.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nCarl LundstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m (born April 13, 1960)\n\nVerdict: Guilty - 1 year in prison, damages to pay: $905,000\n\nCarl LundstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶mÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s verdict came as a surprise to most people since he was only remotely related to The Pirate Bay. His lawyer Per E Samuelsson announced that he has already sent in his appeal and the others are expected to follow soon.\n\nThe court said that the four defendants worked as a team, were aware that copyrighted material was being shared using The Pirate Bay and that they made it easy and assisted the infringements. It categorized the infringements as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢severeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. \n\nThe judge said that the users of The Pirate Bay committed the first offense by sharing files and the four assisted this.\n\nIt appears that the court chose to not take any of the technical details into account and only judged based on intent. They find it clear that the intention of the defendants is to facilitate sharing of copyrighted works and based their \n\nverdict on this.\n\nWhile the court did not agree with the plaintiffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exaggerated estimates of losses, it still set the damages at 30 million SEK ($3,620,000). This a hugely significant amount and the court has ordered that the four should pay this amount \n\nbetween them.\n\nThe judge also stated that the usage of BitTorrent at The Pirate Bay is illegal. Rest assured, other torrent sites hosted in Sweden will be keeping a close eye on developments.\n\nThe defense put it to the judge that he had folded under intense political pressure. The judge denied this stating that the court made its decision based on the case presented.\n\nAt one point the judge was asked if he was concerned for his personal safety after handing down this decision. The judge said he hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t received any harassment and was quite surprised at the question.\n\nWhile the judge wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be getting any flowers for this verdict, Roger Wallis who spoke in favor of The Pirate Bay at their trial and received a mountain of floral tributes in return, noted, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis will cause a flood of court cases. Against \n\nall the ISPs. Because if these guys assisted in copyright infringements, then the ISPs also did. This will have huge consequences. The entire development of broadband may be stalled.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nPeter Sunde characterized the verdict as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“unrealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and said that he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect the jail sentence. He briefly spoke with Fredrik and Gottfrid and all were surprised with this outcome. In response to the fines Peter said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pay \n\nand we wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pay if we could. If I would have money I would rather burn everything I owned.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSunde has already explained that this decision does not mean the end of the line in this case. There will be an appeal which means we are still far away from the ultimate decision - possibly years away. Any appeal from either side must \n\nbe submitted to SwedenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s higher Court by 9th May 2009.\n\nRasmus Fleischer, one of the founders of PiratbyrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n commented, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe sentence has no formal consequence and no juridical value. We chose to treat the trial as a theater play and as such itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been far better than we ever could have \n\nbelieved.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAs for the fate of the site, Peter has already promised that The Pirate Bay will continue. The site itself was never on trial, only the four individuals listed above.\n\nThis is a breaking news story, please check back frequently for updates.\nARTICLE FROM torrentfreak.com, AUTHOR ENIGMAX\n\n\n*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nSUPPORT THE CAUSE AND SEED THIS FILE, WE NEED TO SHOW THAT p2p NETWORKS ARE USED &quot;MAJORITIVELY&quot; FOR LEGITIMATE USE.
