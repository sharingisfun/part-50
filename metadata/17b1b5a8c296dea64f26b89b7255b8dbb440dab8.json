From its inception, Martin Scorsese sets out to captivate his audience with a brilliantly enigmatic and artistic opening.\n\nAn update of J. Lee Thompson's 1962 classic, the basic plot remains the same, yet the psychological aspect is played upon, accentuating the intertwining themes of sin, guilt and redemption. Robert De Niro's portrayal of &quot;white trash&quot;, ex-con Max Cady, a fiendish psychotic, is chilling in the extreme. Not one to hold back on a role, De Niro, bedecked in biblically inspired tattoos, is fully committed in his single-minded pursuit of vengeance against attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) and his family. The Bowdens are depicted in an unsympathetic light, an upper middle-class family with serious domestic problems, due primarily to Sam's unfaithfulness to his wife Leigh (Jessica Lange), not to mention the menacing intentions of Cady. Unfortunately, their 15-year-old daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis) is caught in the ensuing emotional imbrogli, thus creating an easy target for mad Max, thirsty for revenge against his one-time defence attorney Sam, who, having witnessed his horrifying crimes of violent rape, buried vital evidence which could have saved Cady from a 14 year prison sentence.\n\nThe acting is magnificent throughout, with very powerful performances coming from De Niro and Nolte, and 17-year-old Juliette Lewis, making her screen debut, is superb in conveying vulnerability as a potential victim. The remarkable direction, the great camera work and the clever editing, coupled with a spine-chilling musical score, keep the audience on edge, eventually working up to a nerve-wracking climax, which to be fair is slightly over the top. Nevertheless, Cape Fear merits its huge success and is a must-see movie. \n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Cape Fear (1991)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Cape Fear (1991)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 1.24 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 7mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 389 Kbps\nMovie name                       : CAPE_FEAR.Title1.DVDRip\nWriting application              : Lavf52.78.4\nOriginal source form/Name        : CAPE_FEAR\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 2\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 7mn\nBit rate                         : 243 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 306 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.046\nStream size                      : 222 MiB (18%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 7mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 55.0 MiB (4%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 30 ms (0.71 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.4\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 6046\n3/13/2011 7:06:59 PM\nmbam-log-2011-03-13 (19-06-59).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 18 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
