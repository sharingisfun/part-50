Employed as a science teacher, Johnny takes great pleasure in showing his young students the wonders of the natural world. He is also newly-engaged to a loving fiancÃƒÂ©e named Sarah, a fellow teacher he\\&amp;#039;s known since childhood, and is a good son to his widowed mother, who lives nearby. Johnny\\&amp;#039;s life is nearly perfect - until the day his life is interrupted by a near-fatal car crash that leaves him in a deep coma. Six years later, Johnny finally regains consciousness and discovers that life as he once knew it has completely changed. His mother has passed away, and Sarah has gone on to marry someone else - and now has a son. But Johnny himself is also not the same person he once was: he now finds himself in possession of amazing psychic powers which allow him to see into the lives of anyone he touches. Now, as Johnny attempts to reacquaint himself with a life he has been away from for six long years, he must also begin a quest to come to terms with his new abilities - abilities that may turn out to be both a blessing and a curse. Helping Johnny make a fresh start are his physical trainer Bruce, who also becomes a close friend; his mother\\&amp;#039;s priest, Gene Purdy, who sets up a trust fund for Johnny but may not be looking out for Johnny\\&amp;#039;s best interests; and Sarah, who must find a way to make Johnny a part of her life again without risking her relationship with her husband and son.\n\nEnjpy , and visit www.dvdquorum.es for more downloads\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc8b30e75e09c9df01f1f18f5b7520eda80fa5e","amp;dn":"The+Dead+Zone+Season+1+DVD+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc8b30e75e09c9df01f1f18f5b7520eda80fa5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,200,179,14,117,224,156,157,240,31,31,24,245,183,82,14,218,128,250,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
