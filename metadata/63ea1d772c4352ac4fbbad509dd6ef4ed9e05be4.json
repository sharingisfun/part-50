Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSome Enchanted Evening is the second live album by the American hard rock band Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult, released in September 1978 (see 1978 in music). It is Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's best selling album, having sold two million copies,[citation needed] including over a million in the United States. The album's seven original tracks were recorded at various locations in the United States and England.\n\nThe album was re-issued on CD in early 2007 on Legacy Recordings and included seven previously unreleased bonus tracks recorded in various locations around the US, along with a DVD entitled Some OTHER Enchanted Evening, which featured a previously unreleased performance videotaped at the Capital Centre in Largo, Maryland in the spring of 1978.\n\nIn chronological order the songs were recorded at:\n\nTrack 8 recorded 12/31/77, Rochester, NY\nTracks 10 -13 recorded 1/30/78, Detroit, MI\nTrack 14 recorded 1/31/78, Boston, MA\nTracks 6 &amp; 9 recorded 4/9/78, Little Rock, AR\nTracks 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4 recorded 4/13/78, Atlanta, GA Columbus GA\nTracks 5 &amp; 7 recorded 6/1/78, Newcastle, England\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand Members:\n\n\nEric Bloom/lead vocals, stun guitar\n\nDonald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser/lead guitar, vocals\n\nAllen Lanier/keyboards, guitar, mixing\n\nJoe Bouchard/bass, vocals\n\nAlbert Bouchard/drums, guitar, vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ea1d772c4352ac4fbbad509dd6ef4ed9e05be4","amp;dn":"B.O.C.+-+Some+Enchanted+Evening+%5B1978%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BLE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ea1d772c4352ac4fbbad509dd6ef4ed9e05be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,234,29,119,44,67,82,172,79,187,173,80,157,214,239,78,217,224,91,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
