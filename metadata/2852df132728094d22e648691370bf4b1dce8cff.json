Thanks to all of you for the great leeching I've done.\n\nThis ZIP file contains the cleaned up soundtrack of Bill Cooper's 1989 MUFON speech and several montage tracks of my own creation including a sort of documentary that starts with 9/11 and moves on to the Cooper stuff. Also included are montage tracks from an album I made in 2004 and a whole Xmas special for conspiracy theorists like myself.\n\nIt's a CLEAN Zip file (trust me). If you like a mixture of Alex Jones/Power Hour/Hour of the Time and conspiracy documentaries with original musical interludes, give this a try with my compliments.\n\nBest wishes to you all,\n\nsokpuppet.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2852df132728094d22e648691370bf4b1dce8cff","amp;dn":"Bill+Cooper+MP3s+%26+more+musical%2Fdocu%5C%27+tracks+%28by+Sokpuppet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2852df132728094d22e648691370bf4b1dce8cff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,82,223,19,39,40,9,77,34,230,72,105,19,112,191,75,29,206,140,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
