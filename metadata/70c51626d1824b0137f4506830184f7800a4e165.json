Without her, there would be no physics, nor chemistry, nor cosmology. Any field of study depending on statistics, geometry, or any kind of calculation would simply cease to be. And then, there are the practical applications: without maths thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no architecture. No commerce. No accurate maps, or time-keeping: therefore no navigation, nor aviation, nor astronomy.\n\nShe is all-powerful: and she rules ruthlessly. Imperious and unyielding, mathematics brooks no dissent and tolerates no error. In an age of uncertainty, mathematics is the only discipline that generates knowledge thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s immutably, incontestably, and eternally true.\n\nIn this landmark series of films for BBC FOUR, Marcus du Sautoy, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford, escorts viewers through the history of this most important of all intellectual disciplines. In a journey that takes him through the ages and around the world, he examines the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how, in a multitude of surprising ways, mathematical ideas underpin the science, technology, and culture that shape our world.\n\nAs Marcus shows, mathematics was part of the bedrock of intellectual life in the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great civilisations. It was central to the survival of some of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most powerful empires. And even today, mathematical knowledge remains the motor-force that drives the modern world.\n\nThe films in this ambitious series offer clear, accessible explanations of important mathematical ideas but are also packed with engaging anecdotes, fascinating biographical details, and pivotal episodes in the lives of the great mathematicians. Engaging, enlightening and entertaining, the series gives viewers new and often surprising insights into the central importance of mathematics, establishing this discipline to be one of humanityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest cultural achievements.\n\nComplete All 4 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70c51626d1824b0137f4506830184f7800a4e165","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Maths.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70c51626d1824b0137f4506830184f7800a4e165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,197,22,38,209,130,75,1,55,244,80,104,48,24,79,120,0,164,225,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
