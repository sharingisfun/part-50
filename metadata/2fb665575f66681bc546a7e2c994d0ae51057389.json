While at the club VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s LobogÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ he modified the WM formation to a WW, which was later used by fellow countryman GusztÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡v Sebes in the successful Hungarian national team of the early 1950s. This was later refined to produce the 4-2-4 formation and adopted by successful teams, including the Brazilian national team that won the 1958 FIFA World Cup.\nDuring his club-career Bukovi coached GraÃƒâ€ž?anski Zagreb (1935-45), Dinamo Zagreb (1945-47), MTK (VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s LobogÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³) (1947-54), ÃƒÆ’?jpest DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³zsa (1955-56), MTK (1957-59), DiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³sgyÃƒâ€¦?r (1962-64) and Olympiakos (1965-67). \n\nAt Olympiakos, Bukovi, assisted by Mihaly Lantos, won the first two Alpha Ethniki titles in the club&amp;#039;s history. He was enormously popular  but the military regime has forced him to leave Greece cause his political believes.  He died in 1985.
