A compelling story of dictatorship, bloody battles, and endless courage as the Soviet people combat not only Hitler and the Germany Army, but their own leader as well. Hosted by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, this 10-hour program features never-before-seen Russian images, once-secret documents, and leading Russian historians to explore Russia from 1924 through 1953.\n\nVol. 10: The Cult of Personality\n\nRussians praise Stalin for the victory he alone claims. As old age creeps up on him, Stalin's obsessive paranoia continues and he further persecutes his people. The threat of the atomic bomb block his plans for territorial expansion. The Cold War prevails. In 1953, Stalin dies.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5aa45a0b0c6635233de1c9b289f018827110819","amp;dn":"Russia%5C%27s+War%3A+Blood+Upon+the+Snow+++%28Part+10%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5aa45a0b0c6635233de1c9b289f018827110819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,170,69,160,176,198,99,82,51,222,28,155,40,159,1,136,39,17,8,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
