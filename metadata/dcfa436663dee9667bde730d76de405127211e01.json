In an attempt to demonize the freedom movement, the mainstream media is now trying to link the shooting in Las Vegas to the unrelated Bundy Ranch standoff. The shooting follows the June 3 announcement by the Justice Department stating that it will reorganize a &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; task force. \n\nPolitical commentator, author and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza joins the show to explain what made America truly exceptional in world history and what could happen if it falls. D'Souza also breaks down his recent battle with the Justice Department as well as his latest book and upcoming movie. \n\nWorld traveler, philanthropist and former Austin City Council member George Humphrey also joins Alex in studio to discuss the current state of the world and humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
