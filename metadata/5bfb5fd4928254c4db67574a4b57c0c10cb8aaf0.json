Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents linked in bookmarks, accurate pagination, metadata, etc. Thanks to the original uploaders.\n\n\nI just started reading Shields' stories. She's brilliant -- not to be missed.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nCarol Shields, the Pulitzer Prize-winner author of the novels Unless, The Stone Diaries and Larry's Party was also a renowned short story writer. Now readers can enjoy all three of Carol Shields's short story collections Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Various Miracles, The Orange Fish and Dressing Up for the Carnival Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in one volume, along with the previously unpublished story, &quot;Segue,&quot; her last.\n\nWith an eye for the smallest of telling details Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a woman applying her lipstick so &quot;the shape of pale raspberry fits perfectly the face she knows by heart&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and a willingness to explore the most fundamental relationships and the wildest of coincidences, Shields illuminates the absurdities and miracles that grace all our lives. From a couple who experiences a world without weather, to the gentle humor of an elderly widow mowing her lawn while looking back on a life of passion, to a young woman abandoned by love and clinging to a &quot;slender handrail of hope,&quot; ShieldsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enormous sympathy for her characters permeates her fiction.\n\nPlayful, charming, acutely observed and generous of spirit, this collection of stories will delight and enchant Carol Shields fans everywhere.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bfb5fd4928254c4db67574a4b57c0c10cb8aaf0","amp;dn":"Carol+Shields+-+The+Collected+Stories+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bfb5fd4928254c4db67574a4b57c0c10cb8aaf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,251,95,212,146,130,84,196,219,103,87,74,75,87,192,193,12,184,170,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
