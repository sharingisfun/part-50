You should be running the latest PSP firmware for optimal compatibility.  With 4.01 m33-2 I dont think its possible to make a non playable video using this script.  As long you aren't doing zune30 encoding that is.\n\nHere is a guide on how to compile your own ffmpeg on ubuntu:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786095\n\nMost of the comments and stuff in the script are outdated or bogus information.  Some of it is just rubbish.  I was learning stuff as I coded it, soo, stuff changed as I learned more about video encoding and the psp capabilities.\n\nIf it dont workie, well sorry.\n\nDoesn't support PSP 720x480 anamorphic dvd transfers.  You will have to do it by hand if you want to do that.  I figured out the logic and crap to convert everything to anamorphic but decided I would never really use it, sooo, its not implemented.   Same thing applies for iPod 640x480 anamorphic encodes.\n\nOh, also it doesn't support cropping, you gonna have to hack that in if you need it, but not often do you need to crop.  If you need to crop just run ffmpeg manually and pass it all the info that script was gonna pass, well basically, you will have to insert the correct AR and such of the cropped output.\n\nAnother thing, it doesn't support threaded as handhelds dont support threaded encodes.  If you have a multiple core processor just encode several things at once to chew up your processor until you are at 100% util on cpu.  If you have like an intel core duo running this 1x will only put you at 50% util.  So encode something else too!\n\nIf you want to queue like an entire series then just build a simple shell script that calls the program as many times as you want with the same basic options other than file name and title.\n\nDon't do two 2 pass encodes in the same directory as you will overwrite the 2 pass file information.  Make a part1 and a part2 folder and run your encodes in seperate folders so you dont stomp on the data file.\n\nIf you have multiple hard drives I suggest reading the data from one and writing the data to another.  Will speed it up a little.\n\nAVC encoding is balls slow, deal with it.\n\nHere is a sample 2 pass encode string for PSP with iPhone and iPod touch compatibility\n\n./encode-handheld.pl -t psp -pi -n &quot;Good Movie&quot; -f Desktop/Movies/Good Movie/good movie.avi\n\n\n-HR\n\nps.  always check your output before publishing, skip through it all the way to end to make sure its in sync.  Encoding a52 audio to aac sometimes doesn't work so hot.  Also make sure it plays!!!  If it opens and plays in quicktime then its generally alright.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a5c8a4428111921715577af4fcfb8de57ea910","amp;dn":"encode+handheld+v2.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a5c8a4428111921715577af4fcfb8de57ea910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,165,200,164,66,129,17,146,23,21,87,122,244,252,251,141,229,126,169,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
