Well I find DMG to be more convenient than the App folders.\n\nHope you all enjoy it!\n\nPS: To the best of my knowledge this is legal as Mavericks itself is &quot;Free&quot;.\n\nJohn Abraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bceac23a1e2effbefa617e35d94d536a0c0fdc5","amp;dn":"MAC+OSX+Mavericks+10.9.2+dmg+%28from+app+store%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bceac23a1e2effbefa617e35d94d536a0c0fdc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,206,172,35,161,226,239,251,239,166,23,227,93,148,213,54,160,192,253,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
