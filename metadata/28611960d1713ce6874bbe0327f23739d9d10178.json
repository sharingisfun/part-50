It did of course come with a genuine VLK key which also comes with this release.\n\nI haven't made any unattended configurations to this release so you need to write the key down provided ready for installation.\n\nThis XP is compatible for every device for all manufacturers, so you can install it on a SATA hard drive. I have integrated it with every Windows and Microsoft critical updates up-to August 2008. There is one last thing that I slipstreamed, the Windows Vista Sidebar.\n\nNothing is removed apart from the directories which are used to upgrade, sorry for any dissapointment. :)\n\n-----------------------------\nP29GV-PW3QT-2F97Q-6YDHC-PQT9W , this is also available in CD KEY.txt\n--------------------^--------\nRemember to write this down ready for installation.\n\nThe CD key is of course genuine and will allow Windows updates etc, so don't worry about that.\n\nFile hashes of GRTMPVOL_EN.ISO;\n------------\nMD5 : 3C0F3037BEE237E5558A1C9EC601BE48\nSHA1 : E3DDDA1D055EEAE0AC9F7E83FA15C70E42A494C0\nCRC-32 : 80E12147\n\nOnce you have finished downloading this file I strongly recommend you to check the file hashes. A software which enables you to do this can be found here; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://beeblebrox.org/hashtab/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://beeblebrox.org/hashtab/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHow to;\n\n1.Burn 'GRTMPVOL_EN.ISO' to CD/DVD using an ISO burning software, for example;\nhttp://www.ntfs.com/iso-burning.htm\n2.Boot from CD/DVD, make sure your bios settings are set to boot from CD/DVD first!\n3.Install by following on screen instructions\n4.Most importantly, don't forget to write down the CD key.\n\nYour valuable comments are greatly appreciated\n\nI hope you all like it!, and if you do please seed :)\n\nP.S. My uploading speeds tend to start really slow, but eventually it should speed up :)\n\nFor more info on what Windows XP is visit: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-xp/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28611960d1713ce6874bbe0327f23739d9d10178","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Windows+XP+Professional+SP3+x86+LunaIzed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28611960d1713ce6874bbe0327f23739d9d10178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,97,25,96,209,113,60,230,135,75,190,3,39,242,55,57,217,209,1,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
