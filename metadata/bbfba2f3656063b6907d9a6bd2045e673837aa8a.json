As I\ngrow older, my self serving dreams are slowly being replaced by ideals\nmuch higher - to form a charity that will serve the world's most needy,\nto serve God's plan for my life, and to not be held to the false norms\nand ideals of our past century.\n\nThere is so much governmental corruption out there, so much inequity\nand war, and needless hatred and violence. Only by tuning ourselves to\na higher frequency range can we ever combat it. This life isn't about\nhow many cars we have, our spouse, our worthless material things that\nleave us when we die- our life is about serving others, those who need\nus. We can never do that if we are all wrapped up in this illusory\nworld inside of our minds. We must be out there, constantly giving help\nand charity to those who need us, both far away, and here within our\nown homes to our own families and friends.\n\nWe must spread a message of peace and compassion, and only then will we\nreceive it within our own lives.\n\n-Kris 2010\n\n-----------------------\n\nIf you like this EP and want to drop me a line or would like some of\nyour own music mixed professionally by me (it's what I do for a living\nnow) you can find me on myspace / kattrabbit and myspace / 8bitrabbit\nrespectively.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbfba2f3656063b6907d9a6bd2045e673837aa8a","amp;dn":"Kristopher+Rabbit+-+Dead+Faerie+%28ep%29+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbfba2f3656063b6907d9a6bd2045e673837aa8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,251,162,243,101,96,99,182,144,125,154,107,210,4,94,103,56,55,170,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
