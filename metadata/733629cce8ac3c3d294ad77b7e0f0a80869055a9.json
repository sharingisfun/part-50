Looking around You Tube I found the original sketch that clearly inspired it, also with Lucille Ball and Gale Gordon, which looks like it was filmed in color in 1959 or 1960...which was directed by Desi Arnaz shortly before he and Lucy divorced. After that Desi. Sr. was Executive Producer of the first 10 or so episodes of The Lucy Show in 1962, until Lucy fired him for his frequent drunkenness on the set ).\n\n&quot;The Transportation Sketch&quot; was presented by comedian / pianist Victor Borge as part of THE VICTOR BORGE COMEDY THEATRE, which was probably intended as a pilot that never sold.  It might have even been on &quot;Desilu Playhouse&quot; but I'm not sure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:733629cce8ac3c3d294ad77b7e0f0a80869055a9","amp;dn":"THE+LUCY+SHOW+--+Lucy+Files+to+London+%28+and+bonus+sketch+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"733629cce8ac3c3d294ad77b7e0f0a80869055a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,54,41,204,232,172,60,61,41,74,215,123,126,15,10,128,134,144,85,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
