Focusing on the latest-generation submarine, the USS Texas, as well as other international subs, Super Sub tells the story of this incredible invention. Through exclusive access to training missions, CGI and recreation, we ll show how today's submarines defy the imagination: they dive deeper, are quieter (and deadlier), and are capable of feats that would amaze even science fiction writers. \n\n\n2) SUPERCOPTERS - Incredible technology is making these 'super copters' much more impervious to attack, with Kevlar and other advanced composite materials strengthening the body - while keeping it lightweight. Using live action, re-creations, amazing archival footage and advanced CGI, we marvel at the creation of today's 'super copters' - extraordinary multi-purpose helicopters for the twenty-first century.\n\n\n3) SUPER RIGS - As the World's insatiable need for oil and gas grows, companies are going deeper, into more hostile environments than ever before. Watch as we rip apart the largest oil rigs on the planet to reveal the secrets of these amazing technological achievementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and discover if they can survive Mother Nature's most violent forces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Salvatore F.
