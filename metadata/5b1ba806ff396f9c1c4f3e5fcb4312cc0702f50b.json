An enhanced version was released for Xbox and PlayStation 2 under the title KOF: Maximum Impact ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Maniax. Marketed as a spinoff of SNK's major fighting series The King of Fighters, from whence many of its characters originate, KOF: Maximum Impact also contains elements of the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting series. KOF: Maximum Impact is the first 3D fighter made by SNK since 1999's Samurai Shodown: Warriors' Rage for the PlayStation.[1] The game was followed by KOF: Maximum Impact 2.\n\nWhile the version released in the U.S. featured an English dub that was met with much derision (with IGN's Jeremy Dunham going so far as to label it &quot;piss poor&quot; [2]), further releases for the Xbox and European PS2 add a choice of English and Japanese language options. The Xbox version also includes an online match mode where matches can be fought between players via Xbox Live.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b1ba806ff396f9c1c4f3e5fcb4312cc0702f50b","amp;dn":"King+Of+Fighter+Maxiumum+Impact+%28NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b1ba806ff396f9c1c4f3e5fcb4312cc0702f50b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,27,168,6,255,57,111,156,28,79,62,95,203,67,18,204,7,2,245,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
