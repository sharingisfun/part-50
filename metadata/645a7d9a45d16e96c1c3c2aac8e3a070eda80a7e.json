If you are running any iPhone, or an new iPod Touch (2nd gen) this will NOT work, do NOT try it.\n\nTo use this, enter iTunes, plug in your iPod, and do as follows:\nHold Shift and click restore (if you are on a Mac, hold Command and click restore). The browse to the saved file directory for the ISPW and click open. Presto, you should be running 3.0 \n\nThis file is virus-free, and is completely recognized by iTunes as official software... for all iTunes knows, you bought this form the store. Enjoy!\n\nOh, and 3.0 is currently NOT jailbreakable... so don't try it unless you have a confirmed source.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:645a7d9a45d16e96c1c3c2aac8e3a070eda80a7e","amp;dn":"iPod+Touch+1st+Gen+3.0+firmware","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"645a7d9a45d16e96c1c3c2aac8e3a070eda80a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,90,125,154,69,209,110,150,193,195,194,170,200,227,160,112,237,168,10,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
