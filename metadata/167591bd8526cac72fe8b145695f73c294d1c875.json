Fifteen years ago, John Clark came home from work to find his wife, Eileen, and three children missing, with only a cryptic note that said they were going on vacation. He never heard from his family again. John never gave up hope that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d one day find his now ex-wife and three adult kids. After years of working with private investigators, district attorneys and the FBI, he finally receives good news: His children were found, and Eileen is facing international kidnapping charges. With only a glimpse of his children, now 23, 21 and 18, on an international news clip, John struggles to make a connection. Find out why Eileen says she ran. Will John take a lie detector test to prove her claims are false? Plus, meet a woman who says her father kidnapped her when she was 6 and brainwashed her against her mother. Find out how she learned the truth and the emotional toll it took on her and her family.
