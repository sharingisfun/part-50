In the 1930s and '40s, the vigilantes formed a group called the Minutemen to &quot;finish what the law couldn't.&quot; Of the eight Minutemen, three died violently, one disappeared, and one was committed to an asylum. Decades later, a second generation of &quot;superheroes&quot; attempts to form a similar team called the Watchmen. Various historical events are shown to have been altered by the existence of superheroes, such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the Vietnam War. The American victory in Vietnam, due to the intervention of the godlike being Doctor Manhattan, leads to Richard Nixon's third term as President following the repeal of term limits in the United States. By the 1980s, however, the Watchmen have been outlawed by Congress after an outpouring of anti-vigilante sentiment in the country, and tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union have escalated the Cold War with threats of nuclear attack.\n\nBy 1985, only three adventurers remain active: the Comedian and Doctor Manhattan, both of whom act with government sanction, and the masked vigilante Rorschach, who refuses to retire and remains active illegally. Investigating the murder of government agent Edward Blake, Rorschach discovers that Blake was the Comedian, and concludes that someone may be trying to eliminate the Watchmen. He attempts to warn his former comradesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½his former partner Daniel Dreiberg (Nite Owl), the emotionally detached Dr. Jonathan Osterman (Doctor Manhattan), and Dr. Manhattan's lover Laurie Jupiter (the Silk Spectre). Dreiberg is skeptical, but nonetheless relates the hypothesis to billionaire Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias), who dismisses it.\n\nAfter Blake's funeral, Dr. Manhattan is accused of causing the cancers afflicting his former girlfriend and others who spent time with him after the scientific accident that gave him superpowers. Dr. Manhattan exiles himself to Mars, giving the Soviet Union the confidence to invade Afghanistan in his absence. Later, Rorschach's conspiracy theory appears to be justified when Veidt, who had long since made his identity as Ozymandias public before retiring, narrowly avoids an assassination attempt, and Rorschach finds himself framed for murder.\n\nMeanwhile Jupiter, after breaking up with Manhattan, goes to stay with Dreiberg, and the two former superheroes come out of retirement as they grow closer. After they break Rorschach out of prison, Silk Spectre is confronted by Dr. Manhattan. He takes her to Mars and, after she asks him to save the world, explains he is no longer interested in humanity. As he probes her memories, he discovers (and she remembers) that the Comedian was her father. His interest in humanity renewed by this improbable sequence of events, Manhattan returns to Earth with the Silk Spectre. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409459/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409459/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n\nNOTE\n\nIf you want to burn this to disc then i recomend this program put 3-4 hours of video on a 2 hour disc click link below &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5018839/VSO.Convert-X.to.DVD.3.5.3%28vice%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5018839/VSO.Convert-X.to.DVD.3.5.3%28vice%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:085cb3dec1154ec56956427f56e36e8c6c4fd439","amp;dn":"Watchmen.2009.Ultimate-Cut.DVDrip%5Bvice%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"085cb3dec1154ec56956427f56e36e8c6c4fd439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,92,179,222,193,21,78,197,105,86,66,127,86,227,110,140,108,79,212,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
