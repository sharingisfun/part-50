Crazy hamster forgot to store his supplies.     \n    Now he has to visit different lands before winter to find food.       \n    Hamster is so crazy that he sees nothing but fruits. The lands he     \n    visits are full of traps and obstacles he won't even notice. You      \n    have to help him and neutralize those traps.

Change the land's slant to accelerate Hamster's speed.        \n    FEATURES - Simple, but addictive game play - Funny and cute           \n    animations and sound effects - 4 different worlds, each with          \n    several levels - 7 different selectable items                         \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://game-lion.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://game-lion.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                 \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                 ..:INSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES:..               \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    Double click on .ipa and then synchro your iphone with itunes.       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: IMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Start CORE10k.EXE to verify that this release comes really from    \n       CORE.
