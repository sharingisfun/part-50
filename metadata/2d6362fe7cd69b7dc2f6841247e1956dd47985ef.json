It stars James Brolin, Kathleen Lloyd, John Marley, and Ronny Cox. The story is about a mysterious car which goes on a murderous rampage, terrorizing a small town.\n\nThe movie was produced and distributed by Universal Studios, and was influenced by numerous &quot;road movies&quot; of the 1970s including Steven Spielberg's 1971 thriller Duel and Roger Corman's Death Race 2000 (from 1975). It has also been compared to Spielberg's Jaws, with a car replacing the shark. The film is memorable for its sound effects, most notably the terrifying horn blast the car makes when claiming a victim.\n\n\n\n============== File Details ===================\nName .........: The Car (1977)\nSize .........: 1.77GB\nRuntime ......: 01:36\nSource .......: HDTV\n \n=============== Video Info =====================\nCodec ........: 59.93 FPS h.264\nBitrate ......: 2500 kbps\nFrame Size ...: 1280x720\n\n=============== Audio Info =====================\nBitrate ......: 128 kb/s VBR [2 ch]\nSample/Codec .: AAC\nLanguage .....: English\nSubtitles: ...: No \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d6362fe7cd69b7dc2f6841247e1956dd47985ef","amp;dn":"The+Car+%281977%29+HDTV+720p+AAC%2Fh.264+solstars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d6362fe7cd69b7dc2f6841247e1956dd47985ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,99,98,254,124,214,155,125,194,246,132,18,71,225,149,109,212,121,133,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
