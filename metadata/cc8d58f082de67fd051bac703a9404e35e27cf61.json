Hosers no more, became known as a nation of smart, left-leaning hipsters. In Escape to Canada, filmmaker Albert Nerenberg (Stupidity) turns his smart, satirical eye on the emergence of Canada as a beacon of progressive politics, personal freedom and social justice.\n\nCanada simultaneously legalized gay marriage and decriminalized marijuana, making the often derided country a sudden beacon of liberal cool. Montreal filmmaker Albert Nerenberg investigates his homeland's quick and tenuous ascent to the hip stratosphere. Variety calls Escape to Canada a &quot;proud, benevolent, mischievous and altogether winning portrait of a country.&quot; \n\nStarring: Bono, George W.
