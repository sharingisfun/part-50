About 1hr 30min.\n\nDocumenting what would, and very well COULD happen, if we experience what is known as a Super Volcanic Eruption, at a well known Volcanic site Yellowstone Calder.\n\nThe quality is probably my best so far.. I'm not sure what I did differently, but its h.264 with AAC audio.\n\nThanks for your interest.  Don't expect blazing fast speed, like others have pointed out, my name may suggest. ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a399fc5c1b32620dbd59c5733d4b6c63e13e3587","amp;dn":"Supervolcano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a399fc5c1b32620dbd59c5733d4b6c63e13e3587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,153,252,92,27,50,98,13,189,89,197,115,61,75,108,99,225,62,53,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
