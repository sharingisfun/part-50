After their captain dies from a &amp;#039;fatal impact&amp;#039; upon crash landing, second-in-command Carolyn Fry assumes responsibility of the ten survivors who managed to escape the wreck with their lives, but the death of her captain has her mind deeply troubled and she lacks the will to help the people in need of her assistance. Among these survivors is Richard B. Riddick, a dangerous criminal who was being transported to another prison colony by bounty hunter William Johns but managed to escape after the wreck. After Riddick is recaptured, following the mutilation of colonist Zeke, everyone assumes that he&amp;#039;s responsible and after doing a little more investigating, the survivors realize that the colonists who lived on the planet didn&amp;#039;t leave or vanish at all: they were eaten by a pack of carnivorous (sometimes cannibalistic) raptors, nocturnal creatures who can&amp;#039;t stand the light and so must stay below the surface to avoid getting scorched. Johns assumes that if the raptors are phobic about the daylight, then all they have to do is stick to three suns shining their light on the planet and they&amp;#039;ll be fine until an &amp;#039;evac&amp;#039; arrives. That&amp;#039;s easier said than done when Fry examines a solar system model and discovers that the planet they&amp;#039;re on falls into a total eclipse every twenty two years and when the lights go out, the raptors will come to surface to feast on whoever is on their homeworld. With tensions mounting, trust dwindling and people dying left and right, Fry and the others launch a plan to find an escape shuttle to try and escape the planet in one piece: but to do so, they&amp;#039;ll need Riddick&amp;#039;s surgically enhanced eyes to see and guide them through the darkness. But the question is, can Riddick be trusted? And can they hold together long enough to avoid becoming the raptors&amp;#039; next meal?\n\n\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847/\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 3.04 Gb\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Pitch Black.mkv\nDate: 29/12/2007 22:18:00\nSize: 3,267,796,408 bytes (3116.414 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:51:54 (6714.027 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 30/12/2007 03:12:46 UTC\nNumber of streams: 7\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AC3) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Director&amp;#039;s Commentary}\nType of stream nr. 4: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Visual Effects Supervisor Commentary}\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {English Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 6: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {Spanish Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 7: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {French Subtitles}\nAudio streams: 3\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Aug 19 2007 13:40:07\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 32\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nFrame aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.975985 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AC3\nChannels (container): 6\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nMode: 3 front, 2 rear, 1 LFE\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 3 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc325421fc4763d9429f2e307b77816a10f9154b","amp;dn":"Pitch+Black+HD+720p+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc325421fc4763d9429f2e307b77816a10f9154b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,50,84,33,252,71,99,217,66,159,46,48,123,119,129,106,16,249,21,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
