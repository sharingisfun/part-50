With interactive simulation, Multisim VIs help you quickly investigate circuit behavior while advanced SPICE analyses provide essential insight into fundamental design characteristics.\n\nUltiboard offers flexible tools optimized for automated speed or precise control to efficiently design a PCB. Integration with Multisim helps you easily transfer schematics to PCB while cross-probing, and a complete spreadsheet view ensures effective design iteration management. You can export completed designs to industry-standard formats such as Gerber to fabricate a prototype.\n\nComplete the design process and validate your circuit by integrating prototype measurements acquired in NI LabVIEW SignalExpress software with Multisim simulation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    Additional Info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI decided to repack this cause all the packs I came across were either missing important files or packed with viruses. I included two Keygens that pretty much do the same thing so use which ever, they both work. I scanned the whole content using Avast! 4.8.1368 and no troubles detected. However, you might be able to find the NI Circuit Design Suite Power Pro v10.0 trial setup.exe and just use the packed Keygens if concerned.
