Aurora is a powerful 32 bit compiler featuring an integrated development environment with advanced compiler, assembler and linker.\n\nAurora features a C-like syntax with high level commands making it ideal for students and advanced programmers alike. Aurora can create stand alone executables with no runtime libraries needed. Designed to be a cross platform compiler there will be both Windows and Linux versions available.\n\nThe compiler is undergoing regular updates and now has OOP support, GUI classes, image classes, database support, 2D classes, 3D game classes, Unicode support, and features the Scintilla text editor for the IDE. Recent changes to the IDE include a &amp;#039;Find in Files&amp;#039; feature, bookmarks, auto indentation, brace highlighting, class view, disassembler, and a subs/methods pulldown.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ionicwind.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ionicwind.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ed820b153cab7f7a8d23815fa25e09dff10533c","amp;dn":"Aurora+Compiler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ed820b153cab7f7a8d23815fa25e09dff10533c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,216,32,177,83,202,183,247,168,210,56,21,250,37,224,157,255,16,83,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
