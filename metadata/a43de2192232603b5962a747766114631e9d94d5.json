She runs into him, befriends him, and finds out that he is out to kill a seemingly benevolent citizen, Ghajini Dharmatma. After warning the latter of the impending danger, she subsequently comes across a number of diaries written by Sanjay and attempts to put together a jigsaw puzzle as to how a successful and wealthy businessman became a crazed recluse, who re-lives his past through tattoos on his body, notes and Polaroid photographs on the wall of his Hiranandani Complex flat, and his sole obsession of carrying out his deadly mission - little knowing that Ghajini and his goons are out to erase every bit of evidence he has gathered and thus ensure that he ends up remembering nothing.\n\n::::::::::Cast:::::::::::::\n\nAamir Khan...Sanjay 'Sanju' Singhania / Sachin\nAsif Ahmed...\nTinnu Anand...Satveer Kohli\nAsin...Kalpana Shetty\nJohn Cardiel...\nVibha Chhibber...Havaldar Vijyanti\nMahendra Gole...\nSunil Grover...Sampat / Sanjay Singhania\nSimon Hewitt...\nKiran Deep Jagi... \n\n\n:::::::::::::Format:::::::::\n\n\nFORMAT:MPEG-4\nFILE SIZE:891 MiB\nDURATION:3h 5mn\nWIDTH: 740 pixels\nHEIGHT:320 pixels\nASPECT RATIO:2.35:1\nFRAME RATE:23.976 fps\nVIDEO BITRATE:607 Kbps\nAUDIO CHANNEL(s): 2 channels- Front: L R\nLANGUAGE: Hindi\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/9854/54221386.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/9854/54221386.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/9639/83203102.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/9639/83203102.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6140/44270495.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/6140/44270495.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/5753/29860404.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/5753/29860404.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote:::Ghajini + Making of amir khans body for Ghajni ::::\n\n:::::::::::::Enjoy Another Release of Simba!::::::::::::::::: \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43de2192232603b5962a747766114631e9d94d5","amp;dn":"Ghajini+2008+BRRiP+480p+x264%7BSiMbA%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43de2192232603b5962a747766114631e9d94d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,61,226,25,34,50,96,59,89,98,167,71,118,97,20,99,30,157,148,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
