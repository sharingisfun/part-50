It was the 76th race in the combined history of the Australian Grand Prix that dates back to the 100 Miles Road Race of 1928. Originally planned as the second race of the 2011 Formula One season, it became the season opener with the cancellation of the Bahrain Grand Prix due to civil unrest in the country.\n\nThe race, contested over 58 laps, was won by the reigning World Champion Sebastian Vettel, driving for Red Bull Racing, after starting from pole position. Lewis Hamilton finished second in a McLaren, and Renault's Vitaly Petrov completed the podium in third place, the first podium finish of his career and the first podium finish for a Russian national.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51d41943bafee3951b80fb6907a103a71ed2e292","amp;dn":"2011+01+-+Australian+Grand+Prix+-+Melbourne+-+BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51d41943bafee3951b80fb6907a103a71ed2e292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,212,25,67,186,254,227,149,27,128,251,105,7,161,3,167,30,210,226,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
