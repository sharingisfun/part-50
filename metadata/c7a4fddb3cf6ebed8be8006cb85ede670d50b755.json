At first curvaceous Calamity is too durned busy fighting Indians and cracking a bullwhip to pay much mind to such girlie what-alls as dresses and perfume. And Wild Bill is too danged busy wooing a dainty chanteuse to give a hoot about a hotheaded tomboy.\n\nBut things change in a rootin', tootin' big way, with love and romance just down the trail. There are wide-open Technicolor Western spaces, lots of high-stepping terpsichory and a hummable humdinger of a score by Academy Award winning songwriters Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster, who won an Oscar for the classic ballad (and '50's mega hit) 'Secret Love'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7a4fddb3cf6ebed8be8006cb85ede670d50b755","amp;dn":"%5BCLASSIC%5D-CALAMITY+JANE-1953%5BXVID%5D+BY+WINKER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7a4fddb3cf6ebed8be8006cb85ede670d50b755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,164,253,219,60,246,235,237,139,232,0,108,184,94,222,103,13,80,183,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
