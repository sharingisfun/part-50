Because Pelias says to him that it travels to Colchis, and it follows his advice \nsailing during many days with the Argonautas until Greece. But in his trip one will face bronze giants and all series of monsters, although they \nthey had the protection of Hera, reigns of the Gods.\n\nComments: \n\nOf the mythos to the logo, the explosion of the rational thought\n\nMitolÃƒÂ³gico story about Jason, the expedition of the Argonautas and Medea is an interesting film version on the well-known. It films \nreally entertained, with a rate very adapted and rolled with masters, special effects and animations that in their day were does not go more and than today \nthey produce one (pleasant) sensation of nostalgic simplicity. Most interesting of this film it is the approach that has given its director him: a vision enough \nfilolÃƒÂ³gica of the classic Greek thought, the base of the western civilization.\n                                    \n                                                           \n                                                            ----------------OOOOOOOOOOOOO------------------\n\nMythology\n\nAn excellent adventure that tells to the history of Jason and argonautas us, in its passage to obtain the vellocino of gold.\n\nA great production and direction that that maintains to the film at a level difficult to maintain and many of the present productions do not obtain. In \naddition it counts on a good music and a splendid photography and scenes. And to finish special effects, that without computers or discharge technology, are \nof one extraordinary quality.\n\nDATA OF THE DVD\n\nAUDIO (CODEC): 1.0 Mono\n\nFORMAT (PAL O NTSC): Pal\n\nLANGUAGES: English, German, Italian, French Spanish.\n\n\nSUBS: French, Portuguese, Dutch, Norwegian, English, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Hindu, Turkish, Arab, Icelandic, Greek, German, \nHebrew, Spanish, Italian\n\nIMAGE:  Widescreen 1.85:1\n\nEXTRAS: Interactive menus, Direct access to scenes, Trailer of cinema, FilmographÃƒÂ­es, Documentary\n\nRIPP METOD\n\nFORMATO: DVD9\n\nCOMPRESION: Without Compression\n\nNote: New opportunity to download this classic one for which they did not do it in his day. In the previous upload it eliminates all the languages less \nSpanish and English(as much the audio one as the subtitles) and in this occasion I have maintained everything to it. I have eliminated documentary chronicles \nof Harryhausen, (that unfailingly it repeats in all the films of Harryhausen). I have proven to compress it and although I believe that the result is quite \ngood (reduction level 88%), since original film does not have good quality and in some passages it is appraised much granulated, I have decided to raise it \nwithout compressing, since once eliminated documentary, the DVD does not arrive at 5GB, so that everyone does it to its taste, since eliminating the other \nlanguages, it is almost to the 100% of quality. It includes cover.\n\nRIPPED ....
