His girlfriend leaves him because he's inattentive to her, but things look up when his high-school sweetheart, Annie Streets, returns home to care for her ailing mother. Annie's step-father, Buck Baker, is the local heartless rich guy, buying up farmland. On a stakeout, Rack and two other deputies arrest four men stealing fertilizer to make crystal meth; one of the four is the brother of a notorious Mexican drug dealer. The drug lord arranges Annie's kidnapping and holds her to ransom his brother. Rack and the deputies, prisoner in tow, head for Mexico to rescue her.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdfdf867d6ab8daa49923c8456aa2ade689dd181","amp;dn":"Beer+For+My+Horses+DvdRip+%2ASouthernDownloads%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdfdf867d6ab8daa49923c8456aa2ade689dd181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,253,248,103,214,171,141,170,73,146,60,132,86,170,42,222,104,157,209,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
