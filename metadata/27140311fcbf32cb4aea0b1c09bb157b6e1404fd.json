These guys are apparently very sensitive. Then again, we wouldn't have it any other way. Most of the time, The Kleptones can't shake their reputation. Call it a tragical history tour.\n\nThere's plenty of lyrical mumbo-jumbo about the group confronting its demons and pretending to be a pirate.\n\nUnderneath their antics lies a compelling artistic maturity that reveals how they have grown since they were young punks. Imagine the aching walls of sound of Bob Seger's &quot;Night Moves&quot; grafted, as if by a mad scientist from the bayou, to the crass hip-hop assault of the No Limit Tank Soldiers, and you haven't even come close.\n\nTheir sonic assault has made them the heroes of a whole new generation. Does anyone over the age of 15 like this stuff?\n\nThe Kleptones is not so much a band, but an exercise in marketing. Do these guys really need more money? I liked it better when it was called &quot;Pearl Jam's Greatest Hits&quot;.&quot;\n\n- http://www.kleptones.com/pages/about.html\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe Kleptones/\n  24 Hours                                   (VBR 192ish Kbps MP3)\n  A Night At The Hip-Hopera                  (192ish KBps MP3)\n  Downtime                                   (320Kbps MP3)\n  From Detroit To J.A.
