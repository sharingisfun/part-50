Distraught by the loss and further troubled by his conviction that the bullet was intended for him, he takes on the murder investigation with an obsessive zeal to see justice done.\n\nGenre: Drama | Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 7.8/10 (576 votes)\nDirected by: Martin Campbell\nStarring: Mel Gibson, Ray Winstone, Danny Huston, Bojana Novakovic\n\n \n *** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of TS (LINE audio) for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\nI recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29dc55e423bbbf63f48ed8e18747aabf24f22d6c","amp;dn":"Edge.of.Darkness.2010.TS.H264%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29dc55e423bbbf63f48ed8e18747aabf24f22d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,220,85,228,35,187,191,99,244,142,216,225,135,71,170,191,36,242,45,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
