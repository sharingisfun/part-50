Their Myspace says pop, but it\\\\\\'s more like \nrock or metal.\nThe band broke up after the re-release.\n\n\nI noticed nobody uploaded it to TPB, and I am listening to it for probably the second time since receiving it a year or so ago. \nIt\\\\\\'s actually a pretty good album, so, enjoy!\n\nTracks:\n\n1. Exhortation\n2. Love\\\\\\'s So Wrong\n3. Enslaved\n4. Fallen\n5. The Shadow Hour\n6. This Burden\n7. Counterfeit\n8. Paradox\n9. Unavoidable\n10. Omega\n11. Afterthoughts\n\nOddly enough, I saw no copyright information on the disc or the insert...\ngood way to start off my first torrent... ;P\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c912ed3df2671210db7468a898d713b7ddd04523","amp;dn":"Harmonious+Thought+-+Asher+%282006%29+%5BALAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c912ed3df2671210db7468a898d713b7ddd04523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,18,237,61,242,103,18,16,219,116,104,168,152,215,19,183,221,208,69,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
