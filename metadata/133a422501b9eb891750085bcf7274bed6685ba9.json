This was the Permian, a golden era of biodiversity that was about to come to a crashing end. Within just a few thousand years, 95% of the lifeforms on the planet would be wiped out, in the biggest mass extinction Earth has ever known. What natural disaster could kill on such a massive scale? It is only in recent years that evidence has begun to emerge from rocks in Antarctica, Siberia and Greenland.\n\nThe demise of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago (at the so-called K/T boundary), was as nothing compared to the Permian mass extinction. The K/T event killed off 60% of life on Earth; the Permian event 95%. Geological data to explain the destruction have been hard to find, simply because the rocks are so old and therefore subject to all kinds of erosion processes. It seems plausible that some kind of catastrophic environmental change must have made life untenable across vast swathes of the planet. \n\n\n\n\nFile Size: 560 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:49:11\nVideo Codec:XviD\nVideo Resolution: 624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1554 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000\nAudio Bitrate: 147 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer -3\nSubtitles:(External English)\n\n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0605195/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0605195/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n                                                \n                                        \n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitles included.\n------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:133a422501b9eb891750085bcf7274bed6685ba9","amp;dn":"The+Day+The+Earth+Nearly+Died-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"133a422501b9eb891750085bcf7274bed6685ba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,58,66,37,1,185,235,137,23,80,8,91,207,114,116,190,214,104,91,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
