Anselmo's on his own, and he feels lonely. No way! He decides he also wants one of those cars (doesn't matter if he's not a disabled person) and he'll do ANYTHING to get one: to pretend he's been left paralyzed, to steal... WHATEVER it takes.\n\nThe film was a huge flop when it was released in Spain, but nowadays is a cult classic. The film had troubles with Spanish censorship, that forced to change and cut the original ending.\n\nThis rip was taken from KG. Thanks to pa6sur, the original uploader on KG. The torrent contains also some posters of the film and spanish and english subtitles.\n\nIMDB: 7.5/10\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053724/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053724/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
