The CD contains 19 tracks.\n\nReview by Max Level of KFJC: &quot;WFMU put their own spin on Sun RaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music with a wide variety of results. He is a good candidate for remixing because that loose space shuffle of his always seems to have plenty of room in it for just about anything: skronky saxophones, June TysonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctive vocals, odd dialogue and spoken word passages, doo-wop, Batman clips, some droning thingsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ His spirit and energy pervade these tracks no matter what WFMUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intrepid remixers came up with. Obviously a labor of love, the music mutated but with respect for the original, and I think Sun Ra would have appreciated it.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.wfmustore.org/inrewfremuof.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.wfmustore.org/inrewfremuof.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nALBUM QUALITY: V0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f2cca10c30da3de1c098b51ef0aff5e6f85fdd","amp;dn":"Interplanetary+Remixes%3A+WFMU+Reinterprets+the+Music+of+SUN+RA+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f2cca10c30da3de1c098b51ef0aff5e6f85fdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,242,204,161,12,48,218,61,225,192,152,181,30,240,175,245,230,248,95,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
