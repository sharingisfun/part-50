It was released in 2006. The second animated straight-to-DVD film, Hellboy: Blood and Iron, was released on 17 March 2007. The film premiered on Cartoon Network's Toonami block on October 28, 2006.\n\nThe film was produced by Starz Media's Film Roman and Revolution Pictures and co-produced, co-written, and directed by animation veteran Tad Stones. Stones is perhaps best-known as the creator of the popular Disney Afternoon series Darkwing Duck. He worked with Mignola on developing Atlantis: The Lost Empire into an animated series.\n\nHellboy: Sword of Storms was nominated for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More) at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLOT\n\nA Japanese professor of folklore named Professor Sakai opens a forbidden scroll and becomes possessed by the ancient Japanese demons of Thunder and Lightning, who seek to return and summon their brothers, the Dragons, to dominate the human world.\n\nThe Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense is brought in after Sakai attacks one of his associates. Hellboy and a team of agents (including Kate Corrigan) investigate the possessed man's rampage, but when Hellboy picks up a mysterious, discarded samurai sword, he disappears into a weird wonderland of Japanese mythology. On his quest to return to our world, he encounters many monsters (yÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½kai) intent on taking the sword from him, including the kappa, a giant oni, a trio of rokurokubi, a JorÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½gumo, and three restless ghosts. Hellboy also meets a group of nukekubi in a segment of the film that is adapted almost verbatim from the comic book story, Heads.\n\nIn dual side plots, BPRD agents Corrigan and Russell Thorne (a psychic) follow the trail of the possessed professor, while Abe and Liz are stranded on an island in the middle of the ocean where they battle one of the Dragons.\n\n\nDirected by Phil Weinstein\nTad Stones\nProduced by Tad Stones\nWritten by Mike Mignola\nTad Stones\nScreenplay by Matt Wayne\nTad Stones\nStarring Ron Perlman\nSelma Blair\nDoug Jones\nPeri Gilpin\nMusic by Christopher Drake\nDistributed by Revolution Studios\nRelease date(s) February 6, 2006\nRunning time 77 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6744c8e7d349fe78d5bd215a77f86179707787a8","amp;dn":"Hellboy%3A+Sword+of+Storms+%5BBDRip+x264+1080p+-+Ac3+Eng+Mp3+ITA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6744c8e7d349fe78d5bd215a77f86179707787a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,68,200,231,211,73,254,120,213,189,33,90,119,248,97,121,112,119,135,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
