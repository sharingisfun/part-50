Follow Me\n\nBio from their MySpace page:\n\nA mere two years after their initial meeting as camp counselors, Bearfoot earned one of roots musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most prestigious awards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Telluride Bluegrass Band Champions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an honor they share with artists like Dixie Chicks and Nickel Creek. Now, after years of national touring at top theaters and festivals, Bearfoot joins these iconic pop peers, with the broad horizon of the Americana frontier in their souls. Bearfoot is deeply American music. Airy Northern ballads are tempered by back-alley Southern blues, while jazz stomp meets Appalachian breakdown, the whole fused with a signature sexy bluegrass passion. Boasting five distinctive lead voices, the group showcases a remarkable breadth of rich, original songs. Their arrangements soar with smoky, spacious lyricism. The rhythmic bounce and precision of their instrumentation is fiery and inventive, with an earthy focus on blend, harmony, and tone. Bearfoot is sophisticated, vital music. Contemporary guitar voicing set against melodic purity; youthful grit encounters harmonic romance. Bearfoot ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the name slyly nods to the wilds of their native Alaska, conjuring images of rural string-band musicians, and, in its simple elegance, elevating the quintet to the top of a cultural mountain where they overlook the past, present, and future of Americana music. \n\nSaw Doctors set can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4779025/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4779025/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de5777f6e6fb710cf7d75c369e71878fa25aea09","amp;dn":"Bearfoot+-+2009-03-13+-+Nokia+Theatre+Times+Square+-+New+York%2C+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de5777f6e6fb710cf7d75c369e71878fa25aea09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,87,119,246,230,251,113,12,247,215,92,54,158,113,135,143,162,90,234,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
