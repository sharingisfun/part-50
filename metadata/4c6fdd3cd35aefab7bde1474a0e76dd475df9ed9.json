The archive is complete to run on an windows box and unleash the power of a linux webserver (LIGHTTP) combined with a powerfull database (MYSQL) and a splendid scripting language (PHP5). But thats not all. I have thrown in a mailserver (exim4) a spamfighter (spamassassin) a mailfilter (procmail) a pop/imap/ssl client (fetchmail) The best email client arround (mutt) and ofcourse your complete ssh thingies.\n\nYour personal server station in a box. Small enought to carry arround on a stickie.\n\nThe image is currently in its virgin state under 500mb. Thanks to the qcow format it\nwill resize and store all data you want. So your better get rid of that silly live\nimage your still using.\n\nEverything was build on the best Linux distro arround being Debian Etch and is fully\ncustomizable. I intend to keep developing this baby and you may find its blog on &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://qlamp.assist.dyndns.biz.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://qlamp.assist.dyndns.biz.&lt;/a&gt; You like it, you tell me.
