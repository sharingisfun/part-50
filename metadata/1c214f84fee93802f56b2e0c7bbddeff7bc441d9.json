They're for if you want to convert the .drg files to .mp3 files to listen to on your iPod/MP3 Player, you have the album artwork to go with them - search 'drg to mp3' in YouTube to find out how. \n\nNOTE: You will need an ID3 tag editor to do this - Windows Media Player doesn't work properly for different artwork for more than one track in an album. I recommend AudioShell - I won't include this, however, as it is freeware and you can easily get it by searching 'audioshell' in Google (It's the first result). Take note that it is not an application but an extention for Windows Explorer. Right-click the file in Windows Exlorer and click 'Properties' then click the tab for AudioShell Tag Editor. \n\n\nPLEASE SEED TO GET THIS GOING AS I CAN NOT SEED FOR LONG. \n\n\nI-Doser application and doses (including the new 2008 releases)\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4475181/I-Doser_with_ALL_doses_including_the_new_quickhits_released_2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c214f84fee93802f56b2e0c7bbddeff7bc441d9","amp;dn":"I-Doser+Album+Artwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c214f84fee93802f56b2e0c7bbddeff7bc441d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,33,79,132,254,233,56,2,245,107,46,12,123,189,222,255,123,196,65,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
