The show was originally planned to be set in Los Angeles until Dallas city officials convinced creator Matt Nix to set the show in Dallas. Nix said of Dallas, &quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a great city to jump on the hood of a car.&quot; Initially, the protagonists' mode of transportation is a mid-nineties Chevrolet Lumina, but during the course of the first episode, Dan Stark either seizes or purchases a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am and uses it to great dramatic effect during the rescue of a hostage. By the end of the pilot episode, the new car has won the grudging respect of the uptight Bailey, and become the team's new vehicle. Production work on the series began in January 2010 and principal photography of the pilot wrapped in early February 2010. Cast members spent time shadowing their real-life Dallas counterparts to prepare for their roles.\n\n\n\n Rating: (awaiting 5 votes)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc32024cc4694f89ef04fab0a18241f1079a802","amp;dn":"The.Good.Guys.2010.S01E03.HDTV.XviD-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc32024cc4694f89ef04fab0a18241f1079a802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,195,32,36,204,70,148,248,158,240,79,171,10,24,36,31,16,121,168,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
