While Noblesville was randomly released mid-tour, the other four were never released due to disagreements with the venues on how much money they should get from the sale of each recording.\n\nScreenshot:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8029e3d4f519f13f4db04aed62dc8353dd60b8af","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+08.24.2012+-+Tinley+Park%2C+IL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8029e3d4f519f13f4db04aed62dc8353dd60b8af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,41,227,212,245,25,241,63,77,176,74,237,98,220,131,83,221,96,184,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
