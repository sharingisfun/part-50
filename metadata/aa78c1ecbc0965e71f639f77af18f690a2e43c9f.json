Sky described the song's meaning as &quot;being numb and wanting to feel love, happiness, sadnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½anything, really. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kind of like the Tin Man wanting a heart.&quot; In an interview with DigitalSpy, Sky further explained the meaning behind &quot;One&quot; as &quot;It's about being in a relationship where you're ignored - any type of relationship, not necessarily romantic. It's about that point where you don't feel anything - you don't feel happy, you don't feel sad, but you want to feel something... There's always someone in a relationship who wants more attention and starts trying too hard to please the other person. The thing is, the more you try to please that person, the less effort they make because they know you'll do anything they want. It's that stage I'm singing about on 'One'.&quot;\n\n&quot;One&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart on August 29, 2010 at #64.\n\nSky Ferreira (born July 8, 1992), is a Portuguese-American singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“songwriter and actress.\n\nAt the age of 15, Ferreira would promote her music at clubs located in Los Angeles.\n\nFerreira signed to Parlophone in July 2009.
