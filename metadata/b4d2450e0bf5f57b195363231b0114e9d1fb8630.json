She ambushes him at Paradise Hotel in Seong-ju where the cops are on a stakeout for serial killer &quot;Jackal&quot;. Later \n\non, Hyun finds out that the person who hired Minjung to kill him is his ex-girlfriend. Hyun tries to convince Minjung that he isn't the 'top Hallyu star Choi Hyun' she is looking for so that she would let him escape, one by purposely \n\nsinging out of tune. Conversations and several attempts to escape happens, then a fan of Hyun (which is the same one who sneaked into his car at the beginning of the story which caused him to switch cars with his manager) \n\nfollows him to the hotel and goes inside his room through the window. The girl untied the ropes and takes him to her own suite, but hope vanishes as the girl starts to torture him. However, Minjung saved him by using a stun gun \n\nagainst the sasaeng fan which the girl was supposed to use for the torturing. Then Angela arrives and meets Hyun, her boy toy, but is stabbed to death by Min-jung.\n\n&quot;Jackal&quot; arrives then and starts to assault Hyun until he and Minjung reaches the rooftop. Minjung said that she loves hearing the words &quot;I'll protect you&quot; then forcefully kissing him after. Minjung kicked him then which caused him to \n\nfall down a roof nearby and become unconscious. &quot;Jackal&quot; reaches the rooftop then and attacks each other after, which then revealed that Minjung is the true &quot;Jackal&quot; and that the man behind the killing spree only used her alias. It \n\nwas also revealed that Minjung's real target is Angela, and Choi Hyun is only used as a bait for &quot;Jackal&quot;. After fake Jackal dies, Hyun becomes conscious again and becomes glad as he caught Minjung staring at him and walks \n\naway, signaling that she won't kill him. Flashback then shows that his ex-girlfriend doesn't want him to die, but only wants him to experience betrayal. Minjung sprays a chemical to her face to make her unconscious after so that \n\npeople won't suspect her. Then she goes to an unknown company president who hired her to kill Angela and tells him that she died instantly despite of the instruction to kill her slowly, showing a flashback on how she managed to \n\nstab her, gets her salary and leaves.\n\nMinjung books a flight after to Buenos Aires to start a new life. The story closes after Hyun calls her while she's waiting for the plane and tells her to work with him, and her telling him to deposit to money, him threatening her to \n\nexpose the secret, and Minjung saying after, &quot;Just wait, I'll kill you&quot;.\nCast\n\n    Song Ji-hyo as Bong Min-jung, female killer\n    Kim Jaejoong as Choi Hyun, a K-pop star[4][5]\n    Oh Dal-soo as Chief Detective Ma\n    Han Sang-jin as Team Leader Shin\n    Kim Sung-ryung as Angela\n    Kim Yong-gun as Angela's husband\n\n\nMedia Info\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID                        : 238051415771172355440468683003145124187 (0xB31708F559A9D267ADABB0935A7A795B)\nComplete name                    : E:Codename Jackal (2012) BluRay 720p Esubs x264 AAC (AtlaN64.Com) [SReeJoN]Codename Jackal (2012) BluRay 720p Esubs x264 AAC (AtlaN64.Com) [SReeJoN].mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 631 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 47mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 821 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2014-01-25 17:56:01\nWriting application              : mkvmerge v6.5.0 ('Isn't she lovely') built on Oct 20 2013 12:50:05\nWriting library                  : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;226a4b454a626e160c12&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 8 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 47mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 755 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.045\nWriting library                  : x264 core 138 r2358 9e941d1\nEncoding settings                : cabac=1 / ref=9 / deblock=1:-2:-1 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=umh / subme=9 / psy=1 / psy_rd=0.90:0.02 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=24 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=2 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 \n\n/ fast_pskip=0 / chroma_qp_offset=-3 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=6 / b_pyramid=1 / b_adapt=2 / b_bias=0 / direct=3 / \n\nweightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=240 / keyint_min=23 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=60 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=755 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=0 / qpmax=69 / qpstep=4 / \n\ncplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 1h 47mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nDelay relative to video          : 31ms\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d2450e0bf5f57b195363231b0114e9d1fb8630","amp;dn":"Codename+Jackal+%282012%29+BluRay+720p+Esubs+x264+AAC+%28AtlaN64.Com%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d2450e0bf5f57b195363231b0114e9d1fb8630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,210,69,14,11,245,245,123,25,83,99,35,27,1,20,233,209,251,134,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
