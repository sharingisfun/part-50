This involves understanding Spanning Tree Protocol, which is a simple solution to prevent layer 2 loops, yet can create complex topologies, and potentially a slow converging network, which can cause issues for our users. We will look at how Spanning Tree Protocol operates, and then examine how it converges on a real network. Then we dive into looking at how we can modify the Spanning Tree Protocol topology, and improve performance. Additionally in this series, we will perform an IOS upgrade on a router and a switch, and even cover how to fix an upgrade gone really bad. Also, you will learn how to change the password on a router or switch, when you do not know the password.\n\nInstructor: Ross Bagurdes, Duration: 04:53:06\n\nAdvanced Ethernet covers switch loop prevention, enhancing Spanning Tree Protocol convergence, as well as file management, IOS upgrades and password recovery.\n\nFile Management  - 00:21:20\n\tIntroduction  - 00:35\n\tConfiguration Files  - 01:33\n\tTFTP Server  - 01:16\n\tSave Config Files to TFTP  - 17:56\n\t\nUpgrading IOS  - 00:59:32\n\tIOS Upgrades  - 06:39\n\tExamine Cisco.com  - 13:48\n\tUpgrading the IOS on A Router  - 31:43\n\tUpgrading the IOS on A Switch  - 07:22\n\t\nPassword Recovery  - 00:38:36\n\tIntroduction  - 03:52\n\tConfiguration Register  - 05:18\n\tRouter Boot Order  - 03:24\n\tRecovering A Password on A Router  - 14:16\n\tSwitch Boot Order  - 02:27\n\tRecovering a Password on A Switch  - 09:19\n\t\nSpanning Tree Protocol (STP)  - 00:52:59\n\tIntroduction  - 03:03\n\tSwitching Loops  - 04:44\n\tSpanning Tree Protocol  - 02:47\n\tBridge ID and Port Cost  - 04:21\n\tRoot Bridge, Root Port, and Designated Port  - 10:09\n\tSpanning Tree Protocol Port States  - 03:37\n\tSTP Example  - 04:15\n\tSTP Lab Topology  - 04:35\n\tExploring Spanning Tree Protocol  - 15:28\n\t\nConfiguring The Root Bridge and PortFast  - 00:30:22\n\tIntroduction  - 00:38\n\tSTP - Changing The Root Bridge ID  - 04:32\n\tConfiguring The Root Bridge Priority  - 08:39\n\tPortFast  - 06:00\n\tConfiguring PortFast  - 10:33\n\t\nSTP Topology Changes, PVST, and RSTP  - 00:54:32\n\tIntroduction  - 01:31\n\tSTP Topology Changes  - 02:16\n\tSTP Switch Addition Causes Topology Change  - 04:38\n\tTopology Changes  - 18:39\n\tPer-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)  - 16:29\n\tRapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)  - 10:59\n\t\nSwitchport Aggregation and The Layer 3 Switch  - 00:35:45\n\tIntroduction  - 01:41\n\tEtherChannel  - 03:24\n\tConfigure EtherChannel  - 13:04\n\tThe Mysterious Layer 3 Switch  - 03:02\n\tHow Layer 3 Switches Work  - 05:12\n\tLayer 3 Switch  - 09:22","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2d67cbbbc9afbfe1afaa7371367511cdc27a40b","amp;dn":"CCNA+Advanced+Ethernet-Files+Management","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2d67cbbbc9afbfe1afaa7371367511cdc27a40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,214,124,187,188,154,251,254,26,250,167,55,19,103,81,28,220,39,164,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
