It's usually taken as an opportunity to the makers to add a little depth or drama to even the lightest of sit-coms. And it's their chance to gain extra profile in the key viewing season. \nMost shows only get their Christmas special in the second season and usually they come around only now and then. The exception would be domestic sitcoms - such as Home Improvement or Everybody Loves Raymond - where the Christmas episode is part of the decor of the show.\nThe other entertaining side of seeing shows in a format like this, is watching the history of a show's run and seeing how the characters changed and storylines evolved (or not, as the case may be). Like dipping into a familiar place to sample and see whether you like what the show has to offer.\nHere's the list fo shows featured (including the odd New Year's Eve special thrown in for good measure). The episodes were taken from all over the net, so thanks to all the cappers. The quality is mixed, but usually good. The idea is to let others build on this if there's interest. \n3rd Rock from the Sun\nA Beavis and Butt-Head Christmas\nAccording to Jim\nAfter Mash\nALF\nAll in the Family\nAlly McBeal\nAmerican Dad\nBecker\nBewitched\nBoston Legal\nBoy Meets World\nBuffy the vampire Slayer\nDue South\nEverybody Loves Raymond\nFrank &amp; Bing\nFrasier\nFriends\nGolden Girls\nGrace Under Fire\nGreen Acres\nGrounded for Life\nHappy Days\nHome Improvement\nHouse MD\nHow I Met Your MOther\nIt's Garry Shandling's Show\nJoey\nKing of Queens\nKing of the Hill\nLaverne and Shirley\nLittle Mosque on the Prairie\nLois &amp; Clark\nMad About You\nMarried With CHildren\nMary Tyler Moore Show\nMASH\nMy Name is Earl\nNews Radio\nNorm\nNormal, Ohio\nRoseanne\nSabrina, the teenage Witch\nSaved by the Bell\nSeinfeld\nSimpsons\nSmallville\nSpin City\nSpongebob Squarepants\nStill Standing\nSupernatural\nThe Drew Carey Show\nThe Office\nThe Outer Limits\nThe Six Million Dollar Man\nTwilight Zone\nWill and Grace\nWKRP in Cincinnatti\nWonder Years\nXena","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c70ada421bad96db2f2d37af3ef0832e2387bf4a","amp;dn":"Special+Christmas+Specials+1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c70ada421bad96db2f2d37af3ef0832e2387bf4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,10,218,66,27,173,150,219,47,45,55,175,62,240,131,46,35,135,191,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
