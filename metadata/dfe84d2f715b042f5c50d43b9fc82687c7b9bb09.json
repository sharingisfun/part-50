On Luminesscence, one of a number of must recordings\nof his, Jarrett writes parts for Mladen Gutesha and the Strings of the Sudfunk\nSymphony Orchestra, Stuttgart. Jan Garbarek improvises to these string parts.\nThe result, sweeping , contrasting strings with Garbarek&amp;#039;s searing and sometimes\nbittersweet tenor and soprano playing is very special, very emotional music\nmaking. A must for anyone interested in Jarrett, in Garbarek, or in modern music\nmaking. If you like this you may also want to pick up Jarrett&amp;#039;s In the Cave in\nthe Light and Arbour Zena.\n\nReviewer:\tDavid J.
