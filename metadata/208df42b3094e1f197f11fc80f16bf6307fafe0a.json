AAC encoding with Apple Compressor at 256 kbits/s.\n\nFull album as one M4A file. Chapters added for each song, selectable with iTunes or QuickTime Player. iTunes will make a track for each chapter when burning to CD. I'm not sure if anyone will want an album encoded like this, but I thought it was a good way to do it since the tracks are joined together on the original disc.\n\n1. Part Of Me\n2. Time\n3. Sweet Revenge\n4. Get Up\n5. Ground Zero\n6. Never Far Away\n7. Take Me Alive\n8. Long Gone\n9. Scream\n10. Enemy\n11. Other Side Of Town\n12. Climbing Up The Walls\n13.
