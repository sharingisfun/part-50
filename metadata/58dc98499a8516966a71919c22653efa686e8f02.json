We are living in the most productive phase so far in this quest, as researchers delve ever deeper into the workings of living systems, turning their discoveries into new medical treatments, improved methods of growing food, and innovative new products.\n\n&quot;The 21st century will be the century of biological science, just as the 20th century was the century of physical science,&quot; predicts Professor Stephen Nowicki, an award-winning teacher at Duke University who has specially adapted his acclaimed introductory biology course for\nThe Teaching Company to bring you up to date on one of the most important fields of knowledge of our time.\n\nThis intensive, 72-lecture course will give you the background and guidance to explore in depth the fundamental principles of how living things work-principles such as evolution by natural selection, the cellular structure of organisms, the DNA theory of inheritance, and other key ideas that will help you appreciate the marvelous diversity and complexity of life.\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1500&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=1500&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLectures:\n\n01.

I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz\n\n3. Hit the button:D\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58dc98499a8516966a71919c22653efa686e8f02","amp;dn":"TTC+VIDEO+-+Biology+-+Science+of+Life+%28compressed+4gb%29+public","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58dc98499a8516966a71919c22653efa686e8f02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,220,152,73,154,133,22,150,106,113,145,156,34,101,62,250,104,110,143,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
