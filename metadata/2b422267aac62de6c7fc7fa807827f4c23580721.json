Meet Stephanie Plum of Trenton, New Jersey. She's a rookie bail bondswoman who has the awkward habit of leaping first and looking later when she's out snagging bail jumpers. It's not a job for the faint at heart, but it's tailor-made for Plum. In One for the Money, rookie Stephanie Plum may be a bit wet behind the ears, but nobody's going to take it easy on her; especially her first skip, an ex-cop and murder suspect named Morelli.\n\nRead by CJ Critt\n\nFrom the Unabridged CD Audiobook. In 4 parts, MPEG-4 (AAC) format, 128kbps, 473.5 MB, 8.4 hours of playing time. When I have time, I'll put this in a chapterized format and upload that. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b422267aac62de6c7fc7fa807827f4c23580721","amp;dn":"Janet+Evanovich%2FOne+for+the+Money+-+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b422267aac62de6c7fc7fa807827f4c23580721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,66,34,103,170,198,45,230,199,252,127,168,7,130,127,76,35,88,7,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
