This episode is basically one big glitch. I was VERY tempted to not upload it at all, but I figured some of you may still want to try it out.\n\nHopefully the station's signal gets stronger in the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2570811a5718558bd684f2c39224cbaafca09478","amp;dn":"Jeopardy%21.2012-12-18--bad.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2570811a5718558bd684f2c39224cbaafca09478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,112,129,26,87,24,85,139,214,132,242,195,146,36,203,170,252,160,148,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
