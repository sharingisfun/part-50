The predators that once dominated the ecosystem have gone and the remaining wildlife, including iguana and howler monkeys, battle for survival on the small islands. Without the predators, the changes in animal behaviour and the vegetation are undeniable.\n\nAt Yellowstone National Park, Aspen trees and willow bush are disappearing from the landscape at an alarming rate. Could the demise of wolves in the park over the past century provide the answer? The bold move to re-introduce wolves back into the park, may have outraged some of the locals living nearby, but it only takes a couple of years to see the difference their presence makes.\n\n\n\n\n\nNARRATED BY: Edward Norton\n--------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: Strange Days On Planet Earth-Predators \nYear:  2005\nFile Size: 700 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:54:09\nVideo Codec: DivX5\nVideo Resolution: 560x320\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1766 kbit/s\nFPS:  23.976000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (External English)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1075622/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1075622/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: I have reached the totaly ammount of bandwidth at my regular image \n-------------\n              site.
