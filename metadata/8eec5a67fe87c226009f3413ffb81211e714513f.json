Well, this is for your SERIOUS FM08 addict. It&amp;#039;s my own player picture file, it is a work in progress, I&amp;#039;ve been trying to get rid of the dupes by creating one HUGE player folder working off one config file with player ids. \n\nThe main &amp;#039;Extra Player Pack&amp;#039; is now uptp 16,229 images, a small picture version now upto 4,939 as well as a working regens file now upto 1,290.\n\nAs on my other downloads I must make clear, I am not a photographer and have not taken these images. What I have done is put all these images in one place. I have tracked down pictures of the remote players from the 70s and 80s like Viv Anderson or Luther Blissett. I hate seeing the default picture, so where I have been able to I&amp;#039;ve found images of the player/coach, Gary Bannister, Colin Pates, Joe McLaughlin, people kids today won&amp;#039;t have heard of now, but were heroes &amp;#039;back in my day&amp;#039; and all that. Tottenham were still shit, even then.\n\nI sorted most of them last year so many of the coaches are unfortunately generally 90 x 90 in size, the more recent players thanks to people who have created them are in the new FM08 style. Any images in the new style were not created by me, so thanks for letting me include them in the pack, you know who you are I presume. \n\nOnce downloaded, you need to extract this folder using winrar. Once open put the folder into your Sports Interactive/data folder on your C drive and then install your graphics a couple of times.\n\nIf you like this I have others on the Pirate Bay for FM08 Backgrounds and an updated database to 8/8/08 so why not try them if you like this...\n\n\nPeace\n\n\n\nMoskollo\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eec5a67fe87c226009f3413ffb81211e714513f","amp;dn":"FM08+Player+Picture+Pack+August+08+Update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eec5a67fe87c226009f3413ffb81211e714513f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,236,90,103,254,135,194,38,0,159,52,19,255,184,18,17,231,20,81,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
