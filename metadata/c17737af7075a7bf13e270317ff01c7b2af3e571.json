Her vocal stylings offer a juxtaposition of catchy pop and layered, complicated world music influences. This juxtaposing is of late current in the popular music, spreading through the internet. Similar layering exists in the music of the anti-folk New York City artist Regina Spektor, or the French/Israeli/Tunesian tri-language singer-songwriter Yael Naim, or the eclectic Italian violinist/mandolinist Alessandro Mori, whose complicated yet accessible 2006 album bears the neologism of title: Unfolk, thereby inventing a catchall word for this new genre infectious, calculated pop synthesis. Lenka&amp;#039;s eponymous album is the latest salvo it this ongoing process.\n\n&quot;The Show&quot; has been featured as soundtrack for an Old Navy as well as an Ugly Betty commercial. It was promoted as a iTunes Free Single of the Week. Its video appears to be well-received on YouTube.\n\nLenka currently resides in Los Angeles, and has been heavily promoted by her new record company, Epic Records, including making appearances on late-night network television interview shows in America, singing &quot;The Show&quot; with a band.\n\nOn the week of November 3, 2008, &quot;The Show&quot; debuted at number 71 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. As of November 9, 2008, &quot;The Show&quot; peaked at #15 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c17737af7075a7bf13e270317ff01c7b2af3e571","amp;dn":"Lenka+-+The+Show+%28Version+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c17737af7075a7bf13e270317ff01c7b2af3e571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,119,55,175,112,117,167,191,19,226,112,49,127,240,28,123,42,243,229,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
