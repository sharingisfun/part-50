I felt it was worth sharing.  Included is an auCDetect log.  \n\nRIP Jay.\n\nBy now, Chicago multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett has accomplished enough in his solo career to rid himself of the &quot;ex-Wilco&quot; moniker. The fourth such record since Bennett left the group, The Magnficent Defeat continues similar riff-heavy, rhythm-drenched pattern that began with 2002ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s superb The Palace at 4 AM. This time Bennett whittled down a prospective list of six dozen songs into 13 and whipped out an ensemble of probable players (such as Palace cohort Edward Burch) and improbable instruments, including a horde of Hammond organs and a childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tambourine. Bennett has a uniquely nasal vocal delivery which can too often evoke Elvis Costello, but his ear for pure pop grandeur is palpable on &quot;Wide Open,&quot; which could be an outtake from Fleetwood MacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Rumors, and the guitar-driven &quot;Replace You,&quot; complete with its meaty Hammond accompaniment. Leaving more than 50 songs left on the chopping block and his creative psyche ever agitating, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obvious that Jay Bennett has put that former band outtasite in the rearview. \n--Scott Holter\n\nTitanic Love Affair  Wilco  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  Alternative Country","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b15fb6c65599fbc8a0374be5c6bfc1064f851b3","amp;dn":"Jay+Bennett+-+2006+-+The+Magnificent+Defeat+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b15fb6c65599fbc8a0374be5c6bfc1064f851b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,21,251,108,101,89,159,188,138,3,116,190,92,107,252,16,100,248,81,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
