Based in Thessaloniki in the north of the country, the five-piece band played a mixture of cover versions and their own material, the latter written mostly by Vangelis but still sung in English, something which was unusual in Greece at that time. The Forminx released nine hit singles and a Christmas EP before disbanding in 1966 at the peak of their success. A film being made about them at the time was never finished. Vangelis spent the next two years mostly studio-bound, writing and producing for other Greek artists.\n\nFonte: Wikipedia (en)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:673856b74f875e49d5a8bd19574f15762dbf038e","amp;dn":"Vangelis+and+The+Forminx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"673856b74f875e49d5a8bd19574f15762dbf038e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,56,86,183,79,135,94,73,213,168,189,25,87,79,21,118,45,191,3,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
