It is a concept progressive-rock album, based on a story inspired by spiritual or occult side of alchemy (although set up in 20th century). Perhaps Mick Stubbs' voice is a bit too sweet, but the album is tightly designed. The drums of Mick Cook are precise and hard, Cliff Williams (bass) and Laurie Wisefield (guitars) are doing really impressive and good job. That it reminds (somehow) &quot;Kansas&quot;, &quot;Moody Blues&quot;, maybe &quot;Wishbone Ash&quot;, but in general the music is not loud - but proud. A very talented piece, and done with lot of taste... \n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Schooldays\n02. The Old Man Dying\n03. Time Passes By\n04. The Old Man Calling (Save The People)\n05. The Disaster\n06.
