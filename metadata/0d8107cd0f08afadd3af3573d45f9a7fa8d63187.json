Use a variety of criteria, e.g. regular expressions, to match different message parts. \n\nSpammers encode and obfuscate their messages and use phishing tactics, but SpamSieve can decode the messages to discern their true nature. \n\nSpamSieve looks inside attached images and documents to detect spammy content even when the message itself is virtually empty. \n\nColors show how spammy each message is, so you can quickly focus on the borderline ones if you want to check SpamSieveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work.\n\nSpamSieve keeps track of how accurate it is, how many good and spam messages you receive, and how these numbers change over time. \n\nThe log lets you see everything that SpamSieve did, and why, so that you can tweak the settings if necessary.\n\nSpamSieve running on your Mac can keep the spam off your iPhone/iPad, and you can even train SpamSieve from afar.\n\nThe manual is online at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://c-command.com/spamsieve/manual&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://c-command.com/spamsieve/manual&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSystem Requirements: \n\nMac OS X 10.4, 10.5, or 10.6 and an e-mail client\nIMAP mail account (for iPhone/iPad spam filtering)\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8107cd0f08afadd3af3573d45f9a7fa8d63187","amp;dn":"SpamSieve++v+2.8.5+%2B+Core+Keygen+by+request","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8107cd0f08afadd3af3573d45f9a7fa8d63187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,129,7,205,15,8,175,173,211,175,53,115,212,95,154,127,168,214,49,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
