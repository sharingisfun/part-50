The resulting intensity of the viewing experience stresses both the mediated image and the contrast between physical and visual space. Depicting glowing, irradiated creatures spinning repeatedly in a spiraling, circular motion, the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heavy mediation trivializes and alters memory to render it farcical and amusing, like truth slipping away in favour of a more interesting narrative.\n\n-Simultan Video and Media Arts Festival, Timisoara, Romania\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9732ba6841f2abdb052a2f9eefd974fd3e18d907","amp;dn":"Passage+%28Ian+MacTilstra%2C+2005%29+-+Simultan+Festival+DVDRiP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9732ba6841f2abdb052a2f9eefd974fd3e18d907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,50,186,104,65,242,171,219,5,42,47,158,239,217,116,253,62,24,217,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
