Suribachi by Joe Rosenthal on February 23, 1945. &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; is the story of three of the six surviving servicemen, John &quot;Doc&quot; Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), Pvt. Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), and Pvt. Ira Hayes (Adam Beach), who fought in the battle to take Iwo Jima. The picture became one of the most famous images of the U.S. winning a battle during WWII. However, the battle for Iwo Jima raged on for another month with three of the marines being killed in action. The other three servicemen were taken out of battle and flown back to the states. The photo made these men heroes, and the government used these new heroes to promote the selling of war bonds on the War Bond Tour. The three men did not believe they were heroes, even though the American public did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6696a0bc5ef6d52dd234512256c11459cdc3ae4e","amp;dn":"Flags+of+our+Father+HD+720p+%3DNlX%3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6696a0bc5ef6d52dd234512256c11459cdc3ae4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,150,160,188,94,246,213,45,210,52,81,34,86,193,20,89,205,195,174,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
