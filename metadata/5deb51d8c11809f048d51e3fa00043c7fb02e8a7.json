The London-based group recorded and performed in the late 1980s, throughout the 1990s, and into the 2000s\n\nDoubt (1991) Full Album @ 320kbps\n\nPerverse (1993) Full Album @320kbps\n\nAlready (1997) Full Album @320kbps\n\n\nOn a personal note, I absolutely loved the album Perverse when it first came out.  Although it sold well, it didn't have much mainstream appeal.  Perverse properly lays claim to being the first rock album recorded entirely digitally. As a result, the jacket sleeve does not list the traditional guitars/ drums/ vocals credit; it instead lists a frequency range: 20 Hz to 4 kHz- Al Jaworski, 300 Hz to 8 kHz- Jerry De Borg, drum type sounds- Gen, etc. Mike Edwards lead vocals are the only non sampled acoustic instrument on the record.\n\nEnjoy &amp; a quick thanks is always appreciated!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5deb51d8c11809f048d51e3fa00043c7fb02e8a7","amp;dn":"Jesus+Jones-+3+Full+Albums+%40320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5deb51d8c11809f048d51e3fa00043c7fb02e8a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,235,81,216,193,24,9,240,72,213,30,63,160,0,67,199,251,2,232,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
