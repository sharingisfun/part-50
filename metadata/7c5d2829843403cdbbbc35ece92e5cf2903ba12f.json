We meet as equal members of one body, and all we want to do is encourage and build one another so we can grow by what Jesus does in each and every member and sharing that with each other.\n\nIt's a safe-zone for all those who got treated badly by someone, or don't feel like they can adjust to rules by &quot;Elders&quot; and &quot;Pastors&quot; and so on, but would like to live their lives according to the pure Words of Jesus and His Apostles.\n\nYou're welcome. Very much so.\n\nEnjoy, enjoy..\n\nVerifire.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;384e5d4a515e514a5d55595154785f55595154165b5755&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5d2829843403cdbbbc35ece92e5cf2903ba12f","amp;dn":"Acts+%5B1995%5D+Eng+%5B1+AVI+-+512x384%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5d2829843403cdbbbc35ece92e5cf2903ba12f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,93,40,41,132,52,3,205,187,188,53,236,233,46,92,242,144,59,161,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
