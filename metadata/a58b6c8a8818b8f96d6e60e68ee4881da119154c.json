Unfortunately this description doesn't hold true with Water Hymns, their third full-length effort. Certainly The Velvets are still a marked influence--you can tell from the echoing, claustrophobia-inducing jangle of the opening &quot;They Will Call&quot; and &quot;Rabbit is Asleep&quot;. \nBut hoe-downs? There's not much to galvanise here. Led by ex-Indiana farm boy Carl Johns, NoahJohn are American slo-mo indie rock, in the same vain as a countrified Codeine (without that band's painfully affecting vulnerability), or Low touched by the gothic folk of Mark Lanegan. Johns's subject matter can be involving--&quot;First Communion&quot; has a young boy seduced by a lonely older woman, &quot;Ballad of William Roy&quot; has a man die trying to save his drowning wife, while &quot;And the Lord&quot; features masturbation, death and an angry God. And his lyrics, though often overly arcane, are truly well-written. But too often his singing is emotionless, lacking in both tune and drama. Sometimes the band does rise above the atmospheric droning. &quot;Two Members&quot; is an impressive slow stomp, while &quot;Faerie Wings&quot; is a bit like a narcoleptic &quot;Freebird&quot;. But in general Water Hymns is too lethargic to really draw you in\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a58b6c8a8818b8f96d6e60e68ee4881da119154c","amp;dn":"Noahjohn...Water+Hymns%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a58b6c8a8818b8f96d6e60e68ee4881da119154c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,139,108,138,136,24,184,249,109,110,96,230,142,228,136,29,161,25,21,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
