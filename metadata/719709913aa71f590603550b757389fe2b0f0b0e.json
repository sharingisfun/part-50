One of his feet almost escaped a few years ago, only to be forced back into service by modern medicine and fourth-generation antibiotics.   This is Darth CheneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fifth heart attack . . . no word on how many innocents were placed on the alter in his cellar in exchange for this additional bargain with the dark force.  Only the good die young.\n\nIn other news, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFruit of KaboomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ bomber Najibullah Zazi has plead guilty in the plot to explode an airliner on Christmas Day.  Gee, and he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to be waterboarded or suffer freezing temperatures while hanging, wet and naked, by his wrists listening to Barry Manilow records at 100 db.  Confession without torture?  No wonder Cheney had a heart attack.\n\nThe plights of health care reform and the economy round out our topics on the table tonight, join the fun and frivolity!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719709913aa71f590603550b757389fe2b0f0b0e","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy+Show+-+Feb+24+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719709913aa71f590603550b757389fe2b0f0b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,151,9,145,58,167,31,89,6,3,85,11,117,115,137,254,43,15,11,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
