This way, you create a workstation that can be easily used     \n   in any public place, where many people have free access to it, but      \n   none of them can damage (whether accidentally or intentionally)         \n   vital system's files or clutter your hard disk with garbage.            \n   You can selectively enable access to any programs installed             \n   on your PC so that not only the web browser, but also any other         \n   software you specify, can be run and used.                              \n                                                                           \n   Public PC Desktop is a complete solution and is ideal for public        \n   libraries, Internet cafes, information terminals and in-store           \n   kiosks. It is also good for limiting activities of your children        \n   on your home PC so that they could have full access to the programs     \n   you specify, but have no access to the workstation itself.              \n                                                                           \n   Public PC Desktop supports multiple security modes providing you        \n   with an ability to specify the most acceptable type of access to        \n   a locked desktop such as username and password authentication,          \n   time-locked code (that allows users to access workstation for           \n   a given period of time only) or a combination of both.                  \n                                                                           \n    \n    \n              sO wHaT dO i dO nOw              \n    \n                                                                           \n   Install as normal and see the included pHeLL.txt file.                  \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n   ----Scene-Note------------------------------------------------------    \n                                                                           \n     You want to pre a cracked.proper or cracked.working or whatever       \n     of this release with the reason that our release expires?!            \n     Then please INCLUDE a FULL proof for your claim or get nuked.         \n                                                                           \n     As long as the system date is not changed _backwards_, the app        \n     should not expire...                                                  \n                                                                           \n     ...and if it does, then our cracker will need a new group soon ;P     \n                                                                           \n   --------------------------------------------------------------------    \n                                                                           \n   Thanks for your attention.
