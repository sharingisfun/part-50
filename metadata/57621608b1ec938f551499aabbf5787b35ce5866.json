However, I have placed each season in a separate folder if someone just wants to grab that part. The good news for those who have been following the series is that it sounds like there will be a part 4 sometime next year.

It is a pastiche of the works of Charles Dickens, like Bleak House and Great Expectations from which it derives its name, and costume dramas set in the same period, and parodies several of their plot devices (such as cruel guardians, idyllic childhoods interrupted, lifelong friendships, earnest young people). It is written by Mark Evans, who also plays any extra minor characters in most episodes (or is credited as &quot;several Trappist monks&quot; if there are no such characters). Its opening and closing theme is the main theme from the Mazurka from Three Characteristic Pieces by Edward Elgar.\n\nThe plot of the first series revolves around Philip &quot;Pip&quot; Bin and his two sisters, Poppy and Pippa, whose seemingly ideal life is disrupted by the death of their father and the madness of their mother. They are then locked away by their guardian, Mr. Gently Benevolent (the name is a spoof on Dickens' habit of often naming characters after their most obvious traits - Gently Benevolent is actually the enduring villain of the piece), in St. Bastard's, the most vicious boarding school in England, and St. Bitch's, a nearby convent. Pip and his sisters attempt to free themselves of their guardian with the help of Harry Biscuit, whose father invented the biscuit. It is narrated by Pip as an old man.\n\nThe pilot episode was recorded in March 2006; a second series was commissioned late 2007, and was recorded on the 18th, 23rd and 26th of May 2008 at the BBC Radio Theatre. The British Comedy Guide website gave it is &quot;British Comedy Guide Editors' Award&quot; for 2008.[1] A third series was recorded at the Radio Theatre, Broadcasting House, on 7th, 14th and 28th June 2009 and the first episode was broadcast on Radio 4 on the 29th of October 2009.\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeries 1\n\n1.\tA Childhood Cruelly Kippered - The idyllic life of Pip, Pippa and Poppy Bin is ruined by the scheming of their evil guardian and Pip's incarceration in Britain's most violent school, St Bastard's (based on Dotheboys Hall).
