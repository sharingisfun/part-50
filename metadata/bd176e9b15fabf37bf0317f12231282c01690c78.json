Citing influences that include Michael Jackson and Prince as well as Kraftwerk and the Smiths, he began working with the New York City-based label Normrex in 2007. He made his label debut with a couple mixtapes, Jam! (2008) and This Charming Mixtape (2009), which circulated freely in the music blogopshere. London made his album debut in 2009 with This Charming Man, a stylistically wide-ranging full-length effort featuring an eclectic cast of vocal guests and production work by Normrex beatmakers Machinedrum, Jimmy Edgar, and Letherette. The follow-up, Timez Are Weird These Days, was released through Reprise in 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd176e9b15fabf37bf0317f12231282c01690c78","amp;dn":"Theophilus+London+-+VIBES+%28Album+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd176e9b15fabf37bf0317f12231282c01690c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,23,110,155,21,250,191,55,191,3,23,241,34,49,40,44,1,105,12,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
