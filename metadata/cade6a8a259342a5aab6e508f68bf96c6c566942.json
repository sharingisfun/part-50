It is much better than sleeping pills, because a) tablets are addictive, and people quickly need higher and higher doses to get any sleep at all b) sleeping medications like Ambien have been shown to carry a greater risk than smoking to your long-term health, including raised risk to cancer, heart disease and diabetes. \n\nCognitive-behavioural treatments are natural and work with your body, rather than against it. Over a period of 3-4 weeks, you will learn to sleep brilliantly. In fact, sleep will be so easy for you, you will be able to have late nights, or disrupted sleep without really noticing it at all. \nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve called our audio treatment Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Belt SleepÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you will be a sleep ninja!\nFrom the website:\n So many people want our 1:1 psychology sessions, we can't fit everyone in!\nSo we have produced an audio sleep treatment box-set containing all the major techniques and exercises used in 1:1 therapy. Sit back in your own home and learn how to get great natural sleep. You will learn about the science behind our system. Let us (gently) talk you through.\nWe will get you to a point where sleep comes easily and effortlessly - to make YOU the master of your sleep, not the other way round! Any sleep treatment that teaches you that you need great concentration, effort and very precise circumstances to get great sleep is NOT a good treatment, to us. If anything, most insomniacs need to relax, stop trying so hard, and let their body retrain to sleep naturally again. Sleep will be effortless for you again. We'll show you how.\nThat's why we're calling our audio set Black Belt Sleep - we train you through various levels of proficiency (differently-coloured belts) to the point where you can sleep easily, you are not remotely worried about your sleep, and are completely in control of it (a sleep ninja!). You know those people who can have late nights or miss whole nights, without worrying or being tired the next day? Well, that will be you, when you are a Black Belt of Sleep!\nThe system also includes a 20 page workbook. You'll be able to learn the system at your own pace and when you choose, as well as being able to revisit it when you want to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cade6a8a259342a5aab6e508f68bf96c6c566942","amp;dn":"Black+Belt+Sleep+Insomnia+course","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cade6a8a259342a5aab6e508f68bf96c6c566942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,222,106,138,37,147,66,165,170,182,229,8,246,139,249,108,108,86,105,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
