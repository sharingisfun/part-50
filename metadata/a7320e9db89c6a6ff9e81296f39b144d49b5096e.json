Comprised of all veterans of 80's Hard Rock, Bitchfire's all original music combines the powerful vocals of Boston rock scene front-woman Sharyn Peach with the heavy Eddie Van Halen type guitar licks of Donny Sutton-Brown. Filling out the quartet is Bassist Robbie Plast and drummer Eddie D. formerly of South Florida's Sea of Black. BitchFire burst onto the South Florida music scene in November of 2006.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.
