The shine is off the Obama apple, so to speak, and depending on how you look at it, Obama has either failed to deliver on the promised change or hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t had time or resources to undo the damage wrought by the Bush Crime Family.  Either way, his State of the Union speech (while predictably well-written and delivered) was met with disappointment on many fronts.\n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll discuss the aftermath, the coming midterm battle, the future of DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Ask/DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Tell, the Unsinkable Ben Bernake, The forgotten health care reform, and much more!  And weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll play political podcast trivia and give away ONE annual subscription to the commercial-free podcast tonight!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5cc1789d8d8d1d2d0b1ecf35359a888569c059","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy+Show+-+Jan+29+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5cc1789d8d8d1d2d0b1ecf35359a888569c059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,92,193,120,157,141,141,29,45,11,30,207,53,53,154,136,133,105,192,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
