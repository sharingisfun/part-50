Enjoy.\n\nIn May 2010, Dave Matthews Band announced that they would take a break from touring the following year for the first time in 20 years. With the break looming, the last two hometown shows on November 19-20, 2010 at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, VA became two of the most anticipated in the band's history. Both shows met all expectations! We are proud to release the first night of this epic weekend in its entirety on 3-disc CD, and for the first time in the Live Trax series, on DVD as well. This is the First Live Trax mixed in surround sound.\n\nHighlights of the first night in Charlottesville include three special guests. Frequent guest Joe Lawlor sits in on electric guitar during #41. Longtime contributor and friend John D'Earth guests on Warehouse and Trombone Shorty joins John and the band on Jimi Thing. Other setlist highlights include rarity Spoon, played for the first time in over two years, and one of only three full band versions spanning late-2003 to Summer Tour 2013. This Spoon is one of the longest and widely considered, most famous versions performed to date. Blackjack is the first full version we have released to-date. The show has a seasonal flavor with performances of Christmas Song and the show-closer and complete surprise - Halloween. Neither song was planned that night.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
