A few months ago, he solved a gruesome case of serial murders, although an undercover police officer lost her life. A new set of similar murders begins: the bodies are elaborately displayed and the killer uses equipment from art and early movie making in the tableau, or he leaves a clue as to where the investigators are to stand to get the full artistic effect. Stan is paired with a younger detective, Carl, whom he brushes off when Carl wants to get to know him. As pieces fall in place, it's a race to prevent the next killing, quite possibly someone close to Stan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdd87f9e7956c9d7bb9e810185ccfe00673f8f41","amp;dn":"Anamorph+%282007%29+DVDRip+-+x264+-+300MB+-scOrp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdd87f9e7956c9d7bb9e810185ccfe00673f8f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,216,127,158,121,86,201,215,187,158,129,1,133,204,254,0,103,63,143,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
