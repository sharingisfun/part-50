Yet Chuck-U Schumer is afraid of... &amp;#039;the lowly mortgage.&amp;#039; Chuck-U Schumer is afraid of documents, inanimate objects that in the end can be shredded!&quot; \n\nHillary flat-out lied in excusing her husband&amp;#039;s role in creating this mortgage mess. This is history revisionism. Robert Rubin, Clinton&amp;#039;s former treasury secretary and now an Obama advisor, undercut Obama&amp;#039;s line of attack that Phil Gramm&amp;#039;s bill (which Clinton signed) caused this mess.
