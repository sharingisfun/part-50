Everything from standards analysis to characterization of the design is covered in the book. \n\nGPS Andamp; Galileo focuses on developing seamlessly interoperable receivers that can access the wide variety of new services offered by these systems, such as increased service availability, centimeter-sensitive accuracy, emergency management, and data confidentiality. By the end of the book, you will have a prototype that achieves peak performance in terms of gain, NF, and current consumption, making it suitable for any high-accuracy, portable application. \n\nDiscover how to: \nDetermine the specifications of an interoperable dual GPS/Galileo RF front-end \nDesign all RFIC blocks, including the receiver chain, PLL, control logic, and PADs \nSelect the required external components \nImplement optimal floor planning \nPerform validation testing of the integrated RF front-end \nUnderstand real-world fields of application \nGauge the performance of the front-end within a receiver linked to a full-solution platform ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7bc9000bf188c2ea02f8cc031d2f8fd85ade574","amp;dn":"GPS+and+Galileo%3A+Dual+RF+Front-end+receiver+and+Design%2C+Fabricat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7bc9000bf188c2ea02f8cc031d2f8fd85ade574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,188,144,0,191,24,140,46,160,47,140,192,49,210,248,253,133,173,229,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
