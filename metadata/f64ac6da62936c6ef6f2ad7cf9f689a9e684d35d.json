It was among Shakespeare's most popular archetypal stories of young, teenage lovers.\n\nThe film was directed and co-written by Franco Zeffirelli, and stars Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. It won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design; it was also nominated for Best Director and Best Picture. Sir Laurence Olivier spoke the film's prologue and epilogue and reportedly dubbed the voice of the Italian actor playing Lord Montague, but was not credited in the film.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063518/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063518/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f64ac6da62936c6ef6f2ad7cf9f689a9e684d35d","amp;dn":"Romeo+and+Juliet+-+William+Shakespeare++%281968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f64ac6da62936c6ef6f2ad7cf9f689a9e684d35d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,74,198,218,98,147,108,110,246,242,173,124,249,246,137,169,230,132,211,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
