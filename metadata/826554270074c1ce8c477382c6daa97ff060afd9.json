It follows a junkie, named Gringo, and his travels through the NYC he\nroin/drug scene in the 80s. This film is halfway a story, and halfway a documentary. The documentary part is the good bit, whatever story this movie has is halfassed. Note that this is pretty hardcore, as all of the &amp;#039;actors&amp;#039; are/were real junkies. All the needles and drugs are real, nothing is a prop. This is worth watching, despite what IMDB claims. Good luck, and I hope you all help me seed because I am trying to pump as many unique/cool DVDRips on this site as fast as I can, which leaves me having to jump off my torrents after a week or so.\n\nBy the by, here&amp;#039;s a nice graphical list of all my DVDs. If I get any requests I think are good, or if enough people ask for something, I&amp;#039;ll torrent it.
