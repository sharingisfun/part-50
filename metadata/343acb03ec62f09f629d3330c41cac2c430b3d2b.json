According to TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, the song was written during a blistering hot summer. In an effort to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstay cool by thinking cool,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI saw a spiral pad on his piano with four lines written in pencil,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© recalled. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey started, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Chestnuts roasting ... Jack Frost nipping ... Yuletide carols ... Folks dressed up like Eskimos.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bob (Wells, co-writer) didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think he was writing a song lyric. He said he thought if he could immerse himself in winter he could cool off. Forty minutes later that song was written. I wrote all the music and some of the lyrics.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe Nat King Cole Trio first recorded the song early in 1946. At ColeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s behest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and over the objections of his label, Capitol Records ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a second recording was made the same year utilizing a small string section, this version becoming a massive hit on both the pop and R&amp;B charts. Cole re-recorded the song in 1953, using the same arrangement with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle, and once more in 1961, in a stereophonic version with orchestra conducted by Ralph Carmichael. The latter recording is generally regarded as definitive and continues to receive considerable radio airplay each holiday season, while ColeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original 1946 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1974. Mel TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© himself eventually recorded his own versions in 1954 and again in 1965 and 1992.\n\nMy Kind of Christmas is a Christmas album and the third studio album by American pop singer Christina Aguilera, released in 2000.\n\nWhile &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; was recorded during her debut album sessions, all of the other songs from My Kind of Christmas were recorded while Aguilera was on tour in mid-late 2000. The album was recorded at the same time as Aguilera was recording her Spanish-language album Mi ReflejoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the albums were released one month apart. The album went platinum in the U.S. and sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.\n\n&quot;Christmas Time&quot; was shipped to radio in mid-November 2000 and served as the first (and only) single to be released off the album, though not receiving any video treatment.\n\nIronically the track &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot; entered the Billboard Hot Ringtones at number thirty-eight in December 2007.\n\nIn addition, &quot;Climb Every Mountain&quot;, originally performed by Julie Andrews in the movie &quot;The Sound of Music, and which can be heard on her &quot;My Reflection&quot; DVD, was recorded for &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; but the song remained absent when the physical release became available. The song has yet to be leaked through the internet, or through any other available source.\n\n&quot;These Are the Special Times&quot; is a cover of the title track from Celine Dion's 1998 christmas album These Are Special Times.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343acb03ec62f09f629d3330c41cac2c430b3d2b","amp;dn":"Christina+Aguilera+-+The+Christmas+Song++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343acb03ec62f09f629d3330c41cac2c430b3d2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,58,203,3,236,98,240,159,98,157,51,48,196,28,172,44,67,11,61,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
