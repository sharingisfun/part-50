He was scrambling up the ladder at Drake &amp; Sweeney, a giant D.C. firm with eight hundred lawyers. The money was good and getting better; a partnership was three years away. He was a rising star with no time to waste, no time to stop, no time to toss a few coins into the cups of panhandlers. No time for a conscience. But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man? Michael did some digging, and learned that he was a mentally ill veteran who'd been in and out of shelters for many years. Then Michael dug a little deeper, and found a dirty secret, and the secret involved Drake &amp; Sweeney. \nThe first track derailed; the ladder collapsed. Michael bolted from the firm and took a top-secret file with him.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b454ee7722d8689f77249992e81cacb078264d","amp;dn":"THE+STREET+LAWYER+-+John+Grisham.+Read+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b454ee7722d8689f77249992e81cacb078264d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,180,84,238,119,34,216,104,159,119,36,153,146,232,28,172,176,120,38,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
