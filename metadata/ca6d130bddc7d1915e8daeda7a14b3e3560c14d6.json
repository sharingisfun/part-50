This season starts with Dr. House (Golden Globe winner Hugh Laurie) pursuing his ex-wife Stacy (Sela Ward) and ending with a tragedy that could potentially be deadly for himself and two colleagues. The premise of each show follows a set routine--a patient is brought in with unusual symptoms; House challenges his trio of underlings to diagnose the problem; they treat the patient, usually incorrectly the first few tries; and then at the very last minute--through a revelation that often has little to do with the patient--House figures out what\\&amp;#039;s wrong and saves the day.\n\n\t=======================================================================\n\t\t\t\tEncoding Information\n\t=======================================================================\n\n\tCodec..............: MPEG-4 Video\n\tResolution.........: 320x240 (Standard 4:3)\n\tVideo Bit Stream...: ~640 kbps\n\tAudio Bit Stream...: 128kbps (64kbps Stereo)\n\tMovie FPS..........: 23.98\n\tOriginal Src Credit: N/A\n\n\n\t=======================================================================\n      \t                        NOTES\n\t=======================================================================\n\n\tTagged as a TV Show for your iPod.\n\tStandard MP4 Formating, so YES you can watch without an iPod!\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6d130bddc7d1915e8daeda7a14b3e3560c14d6","amp;dn":"House+Season+2+-%5B+iPod+Encoded%5D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6d130bddc7d1915e8daeda7a14b3e3560c14d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,109,19,11,221,199,209,145,94,141,174,218,122,20,179,227,86,12,20,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
