Hetfield&amp;#039;s Motorbreath Pub Band\n\n\n&quot;Beatallica is a mash-up band that plays music made from combinations of songs of The Beatles and Metallica. A Beatallica song is typically a blend of a Beatles song and a Metallica song with a related title (e.g. The Thing That Should Not Let It Be, combining The Beatles&amp;#039; Let It Be and Metallica&amp;#039;s The Thing That Should Not Be or And Justice for All My Loving combining Metallica&amp;#039;s And Justice for All and the Beatles&amp;#039; All My Loving), though sometimes just a Beatles song will be used as a basis with modified lyrics. The lyrics slip back and forth between the two songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½occasionally neither in lieu of original lyrics comically referencing Metallica, heavy metal music or the heavy metal communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½while the scansion and melody are usually Beatles-based, the music is played metal style with some Metallica riffs and solos thrown in. Consistent quirks made in the lyrics also criticize glam metal much in the fashion that thrash metal fans would do.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sgt. Hetfield&amp;#039;s Motorbreath Pub Band is the first published album from Beatallica. It contains 13 tracks, made from combinations of The Beatles and Metallica songs.&quot;\n\n1. &quot;Sgt.
