There, her unique personal style immediately sets her apart from her self-absorbed, fast-living peers, especially reigning fashionistas Inga and Trish, who can&amp;#039;t quite figure her out but know that everything about her is different--from her super-smarts and retro manners to her perfect picnic lunches and penny loafers. Their less-than-warm reception might bother the average new girl in town, but not Nancy. She has more important things to think about--namely, a brand new mystery. Even though she promised her worried Dad that she&amp;#039;d quit the &quot;sleuthing&quot; business, it isn&amp;#039;t long before Nancy gets a lead on one of the greatest unsolved cases of all time: the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of famous actress Dehlia Draycott. It happens that the Drews are staying in the former Draycott mansion, long reputed to be haunted and now a site where some very strange things have been happening. How could she resist? \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ecf8f551db388a37042325c333fb25f41ac2ef0","amp;dn":"VO.Nancy+Drew+%282007%29+%5BDVDRip%5D%5BIngles%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ecf8f551db388a37042325c333fb25f41ac2ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,207,143,85,29,179,136,163,112,66,50,92,51,63,178,95,65,172,46,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
