When introduced in 1954, its offset space-age lines, contoured body, and three-pickup configuration set the music world on its earÃ¢â‚¬â€it was truly unlike any guitar that had come before. In the hands of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beloved players, the Stratocaster has since become a popular weapon of choice among rock, blues, jazz, and country players and, not coincidentally, is also one of the most copied electric guitars of all time.\n\nIn this authoritatively written, painstakingly curated, and gloriously presented tribute to the 60-year-old Fender Stratocaster, author Dave Hunter covers the guitarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history from concept, design, and model launch through its numerous variations and right up to the present. The story is illustrated with archival images of Stratocasters and their players in action, studio shots of Stratocasters of varied vintage and provenance, memorabilia associated with famous players, and profiles of over 30 noted Strat slingers through the ages. Influential rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rollers like Buddy Holly, Hank Marvin, Ike Turner, and Dick Dale; blues players like Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Cray, Bonnie Raitt, and John Mayer; metal gods Richie Blackmore, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Dave Murray; esteemed rockers Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Ronnie Wood, Robbie Robertson, Rory Gallagher, Mark Knopfler, and Wayne Kramer; and post-punk heroes The Edge, John Frusciante, and Billy Corgan are all included. And so, of course, is Jimi Hendrix. With its unprecedented level of detail and stunning visuals, The Fender Stratocaster is the only book tribute worthy of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest guitar.
