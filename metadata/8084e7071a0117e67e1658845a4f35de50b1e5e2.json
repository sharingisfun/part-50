(But unrar it first.)\nPut this exremly tiny file in a DIRECTORY wherever you like and doubleclick on it, and play. It will make a hiscore-file (1 kb) and that\\&amp;#039;s all.\n\nIt is very small, and no install need. PERFECT simply. Run it whenever you got some spare time to kill. If you need a break, just press WINDOW-button.\n\nFrom the beginning this was written to the Amiga computer by Marcell Byranyai, but Peter Liepa likes to play it on a PC, so he convert it, and that very good also. Thanks to both for a dam nice game.\n\nProbably same as http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3384722/BoulderDash.exe but nobody seems to seed there anylonger.\n\n---\n\nI try upload this earlier, but it didn\\&amp;#039;t work. I used this time WinRAR instead of an executable file, and try again now. Sorry, but not my fault.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8084e7071a0117e67e1658845a4f35de50b1e5e2","amp;dn":"BoulderDash.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8084e7071a0117e67e1658845a4f35de50b1e5e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,132,231,7,26,1,23,230,126,22,88,132,90,79,53,222,80,177,229,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
