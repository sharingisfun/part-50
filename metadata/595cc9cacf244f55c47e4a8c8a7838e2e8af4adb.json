In other words, When and Where offers nothing new from the band, but it is far from a bad record. The group has gotten predictable, but they continue to shine, whether it's on the rowdy rockers or the surprisingly smooth, radio-ready ballads. They do have a problem coming up with a batch of consistent material, but the album is as enjoyable as its predecessor and nearly as solid. -- Thom Owens \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.When and where [02:27] \n 02.Right track wrong train [03:27] \n 03.Toss a little bone [03:51] \n 04.When he was my age [03:15] \n 05.Bill's laundromat, bar and [03:41] \n grill \n 06.All I wanted [04:17] \n 07.See ya [02:50] \n 08.Sounds of home [03:17] \n 09.Oh no [03:47] \n 10.My baby's lovin' [03:50] \n ____ \n \n 34:42 min \n 49,7 MB \n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
