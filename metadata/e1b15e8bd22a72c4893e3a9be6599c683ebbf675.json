Stephen Hoye delivers a solid reading complete with an astounding Cousteau impersonation that will have listeners questioning just who they are listening to during the introduction. Hoye transports the audience around the globe and under the sea, capturing the tense incidents throughout the tale in a believable manner. Though most of the tale is told from Schiefelbein&amp;#039;s perspective, Hoye manages to capture the spirit of Cousteau without always resorting to the impersonation. His reading is underplayed and all the more realistic because of it. As Cousteau would have demanded, the conservation information included becomes the star of the show, and the story is a medium to spread the word about Mother Earth.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b15e8bd22a72c4893e3a9be6599c683ebbf675","amp;dn":"Jacques+Cousteau+-+The+Human%2C+the+Orchid%2C+and+the+Octopus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b15e8bd22a72c4893e3a9be6599c683ebbf675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,177,94,139,210,42,114,196,137,62,58,155,230,89,156,104,62,187,246,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
