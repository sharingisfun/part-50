She befriends her roommates, Zoe and Miles, who teach hip-hop classes. She has ballet classes with the rigid and famous Monique Delacroix that she idolizes - Monique requires full commitment, discipline and hard work from her students. When Miles, who is a composer, invites Sara to help him compose the music for the dance choreography Sara's passion for hip-hop is sparked and she also falls in love with Miles. When she is assigned to perform Giselle in an important event, she feels divided between the technique of the ballet and the creative work offered by Miles.\n\nCats :\nIzabella Miko\t ... \tSara\nColumbus Short\t... \tMiles\nJacqueline Bisset\t... \tMonique\nMaria Brooks\t... \tKatrina\nAubrey Dollar\t... \tZoe\nIan Brennan\t... \tFranz\nTre Armstrong\t... \tCandy (as Tracey 'Tre' Armstrong)\nSeana McKenna\t... \tSimone\nNe-Yo\t... \tMixx\nDiane Fabian\t... \tBella the Pianist\nRobert Allan\t... \tPaul\nMatt Watling\t... \tMarcus\nEvan Williams\t... \tShane\nBrendan Wall\t... \tNigel\nMichael Hanrahan\t... \tMr. Stills\n\nData Technical :\n!!!
