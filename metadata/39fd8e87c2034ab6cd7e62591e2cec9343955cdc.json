The benefit of this method is the ability to test various software under various operating systems, while not causing harm to the current system, installed on my main computer, as well as some test hardware solutions. Can make life easier for developers to cross-platform applications and lovers to work with the new OS.\n\nAmong the new features VMware Workstation 7:\n\n* Ability to select as a guest OS virtual machine, VMware vSphere 4;\n* Support for Windows 7 as a guest and host OS;\n* WDDM driver for the guest operating system Windows 7;\n* OpenGL and Shader Model 3.0 for guest Windows XP and Vista;\n* Dynamic Download VMware Tools;\n* Multi-core and four virtual machines (4 vCPU);\n* Ability to print from a virtual machine without installing the drivers at the expense of ThinPrint;\n* Create snapshots at set intervals (AutoProtect);\n* Protecting virtual machines 128-bit encryption;\n* Support for the ALSA library for guest operating system Linux, which will play music from multiple virtual machines simultaneously;\n* Improved Linux Virtual Network Editor.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39fd8e87c2034ab6cd7e62591e2cec9343955cdc","amp;dn":"VMWARE+WORKSTATION+V7+%5Bthethingy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39fd8e87c2034ab6cd7e62591e2cec9343955cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,253,142,135,194,3,74,182,205,126,98,89,30,44,236,147,67,149,92,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
