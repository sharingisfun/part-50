The Host Protection module proactively monitors for and blocks sophisticated hacking techniques used to compromise or steal data. By analyzing threats and displaying actionable alerts, Host Protection blocks zero-day attacks and other unauthorized activities, providing advanced protection against botnets, rootkits and inadvertent data disclosure. This latest version extends the range of monitored events and operations for even greater and more customizable protection. Outpost excels in all currently-known leaktests, with additional focus on keylogger-like activities.\n\nBoth anti-virus and anti-spyware capabilities are provided through the universal Anti-Malware module, which ensures that your computer is kept clean of any malicious program that might infect it while youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re surfing the web. The on-access monitor constantly watches for and instantly disinfects, quarantines or removes any malware objects found in key areas of the PC, while the on-demand scanner lets you scan for and remove threats on hard disks, network folders, DVDs, or external storage devices. Email attachments are checked in real time as they leave or arrive, and you can move any suspicious file to the quarantine area for later review. Additional protection now prevents known rootkits and other sophisticated malware from loading and embedding themselves on your PC.\n\nFeatures:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Preemptive threat protection\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Self-protection\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 360-degree malware defense\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Scheduled scans and exclusions\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Connection security\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Application access control\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Comprehensive coverage\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Intrusion protection\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Protection from spam\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Unsafe web site access restriction\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ IP Blocklist keeps surfing clean\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Safe repository for personal data\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ad-free, anonymous surfing\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Network activity monitoring\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Password-protection, multiple configuration profiles\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Better manageable events logs\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Driver certification and latest Windows platforms compatibility\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ IPv6 support\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Adaptive firewall rules\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Entertainment mode for uninterrupted gameplay and video viewing\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Auto-learning mode\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Automatic configuration\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Improvenet delivers more ready-made configurations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ SmartAdvisor - instant, context-sensitive help\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Hands-free updates\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Faster, more intelligent scans\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e9e985f250d9faca1eda8e8d9f7cbff6e06cf37","amp;dn":"Agnitum.Outpost.Security.Suite.Pro.2009.v6.5.7.2954-UNiQUE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e9e985f250d9faca1eda8e8d9f7cbff6e06cf37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,158,152,95,37,13,159,172,161,237,168,232,217,247,203,255,110,6,207,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
