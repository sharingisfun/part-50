Star tenor Jonas Kaufmann sings a selection of popular arias by Puccini in a programme which also includes Richard Strauss's sparkling tone poem Till Eulenspiegel and Arvo PÃƒÂ¤rt's Credo, a crashing musical battle between good and evil performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and the BBC Singers. The remarkable 23-year-old British pianist Benjamin Grosvenor plays Shostakovich's second piano concerto and the concert begins with the world premiere of the new BBC commission Arise Athena! by the Jamaican-born composer Eleanor Alberga.\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/09/14/a0ff36a62077e449f8ae63ae1ecfbe13.png[/img]\n\nBBC.Proms.2015.09.12.Part_2_EN.SUB.BBC.ONE.WEBRIP.[MPup]\n\nRuntime: 01:30:00.00\n\nKatie Derham introduces the celebrations live from the Royal Albert Hal,l as the world's greatest music festival reaches the grand finale of its 120th anniversary year.\n\nTenor Jonas Kaufmann, soprano Danielle de Niese and pianist Benjamin Grosvenor are the star soloists in a programme which includes popular favourites by Gershwin, LehÃƒÂ¡r and James P Johnson, as well as a performance of Grieg's 'Morning' from Peer Gynt, which appeared in the first ever Last Night in 1895.\n\nAround the UK, Proms in the Park audiences in Belfast, Glasgow, Swansea and London will join the Royal Albert Hall for a medley of favourites from The Sound Of Music to mark the 50th anniversary of the classic film. Each of the four parks will also have their moment in the spotlight as part of a UK-wide singalong of Aaron Copland's I Bought Me A Cat, before the traditional climax of Rule Britannia, Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem. The BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and the BBC Singers are conducted by Marin Alsop.\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/09/14/1c070a53572b6da313d4f1a10a62769f.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca413286c763010e428969f7fac29ef20be4ba7","amp;dn":"Last+Night+at+the+Proms+Part+1-2+x265+MKV+EN+SUB+BBCRip+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ca413286c763010e428969f7fac29ef20be4ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,164,19,40,108,118,48,16,228,40,150,159,127,172,41,239,32,190,75,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
