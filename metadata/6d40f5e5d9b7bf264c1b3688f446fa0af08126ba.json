However, with the advances in graphics technology and gameplay design since the original game, without the name and the occasional in-game references, it might be unrecognizable as a part of the series.\n\nIt features a story-based single player campaign (taking up many of the themes from the original game), as well as a team-based networked multiplayer version which features different character classes that must work together in order to win, similar to the concept of Team Fortress. Although there are only four classes - lieutenant, medic, engineer, and soldier - the soldier can be one of several subclasses depending upon the special/heavy weapon that he selects. Some unique weapons not found in other WWII-themed first-person shooters include the airstrike beacon. The multiplayer demo included a beachhead assault map similar to the opening of the movie Saving Private Ryan.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d40f5e5d9b7bf264c1b3688f446fa0af08126ba","amp;dn":"Return+to+Castle+Wolfenstein-FALLOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d40f5e5d9b7bf264c1b3688f446fa0af08126ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,64,245,229,217,183,191,38,76,27,54,136,244,70,250,10,240,129,38,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
