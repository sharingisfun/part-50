In this film, Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is only eight days away from retirement and his partner \n\nMartin Riggs (Mel Gibson) once again manages to get them both into hot water with the both LAPD and the bad guys, who this \n\ntime are Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson) and a gang of hoodlums selling armor-piercing bullets. Joe Pesci returns as the \n\nfast-talking schmuck Leo Getz. A new addition to the cast is Rene Russo as Lorna Cole, a sergeant from internal affairs sent \n\nto investigate Riggs and Murtaugh, but who ultimately ends up falling in love with the caffienated Riggs.\n\n                            \n\n\n\t\t\t\tM P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t                                 Rated R  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t       R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n\t\t\t\t\t15 May 1992\n\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******:\n         * Video - UNTOUCHED - 4265 Kbps\n         * Audio - English, French, Spanish\n         * Subs  - English, Spanish, French\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n\n        Extras **********:\n         * All\n\n        Ripped **********:\n         * Nothing\n\n\n        Chapters ********:\n\n1.
