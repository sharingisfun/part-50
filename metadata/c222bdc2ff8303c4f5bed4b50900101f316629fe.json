This will convert ZVR to WAV, or play ZVR direct.\n\nI've used this on Windows 7 64-bit, and it works fine.  (didn't try it with acutal device though, only with zvr file playback and conversion)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n--------------------------\n\nReadme:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           README.TXT                           \n         Digital Voice Tracer Download Manager Version 3.2 and 3.7\n                   Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista\n\n                          May 2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c)Copyright Philips Austria GmbH, Philips Speech Processing, 2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis file contains last minute information on Digital VoiceTracer\nDownload Manager software.\n\nNote that this may overrule information in the Online Help.\n\nCONTENTS\n========\n1.

Installing Digital Voice Tracer Download manager\n===================================================\nThe Digital Voice Tracer Download manager comes with an Autorun.EXE. \nStart the installation by selecting &quot;Setup&quot; and follow \nthe instructions given by the Wizard.\n\n2.  Problems solved in this version\n=================================\n- Moving files\n  The download manager software can now move MP3 files, recorded on the \n  Digital Voice Tracer, back to a voice folder (A, B, C, D) on the device.\n\n  The previous version could only move MP3 files, recorded on the device,\n  back to the Music (M) folder. This version solves this problem.\n\n- Download Manager Window view\n  When maximizing and then minimizing the window of download manager the \n  icons of the lower bar disapeared and could not be made visible again. \n\n- Windows Vista compatibility\n  Versions 3.2 and 3.7 are compatible with Windows Vista. \n\n3. Known problems\n=================\n- Moving files\n  A Download Manager warning message stating \n\n  `Uploading/Downloading/Formatting now!!!Ã‚Â´\n\n  might appear when moving files, for example in MP3 format, from the PC\n  to the VoiceTracer when running virus scanner software, such as from\n  www.ikarus-software.at, at the same time.\n\n  WORKAROUND:\n  Select the first file, move it to the Voice Tracer and wait till it \n  has been uploaded completely before moving the next file.\n\n  Alternatively you can also use the Microsoft Explorer to move files\n  from the PC to the Voice Tracer.\n\n4. Known limitations\n====================\n-  Devices with lower serial numbers than listed bellow, are not supported with Download Manager Version 2.0 and higer.\n   These Devices work with the Download Manager 1.95 Version and are not compatible to Windows Vista.\n\n7650/7650x\t (S/N: 006401 ~)\t \n7670\t         (S/N: 021301 ~)\t \n7680\t         (S/N: 007901 ~)\t \n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nDigital Voice Tracer is a registered trademarks of Koninklijke\nPhilips Electronics N.V.
