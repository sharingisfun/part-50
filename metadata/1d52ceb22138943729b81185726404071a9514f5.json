Over the winter break Honda withdrew from the championship and it was with only weeks to spare that Ross Brawn completed the takeover of the team, which was relaunched as Brawn GP.\n\nNo one could have predicted that this new team would arrive at the first race of the year and dominate so completely. Button led the charge for Brawn, securing six wins in the seven opening races, with Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello notching up numerous podium and point-scoring finishes to reinforce the extraordinary performance of the team.\n\nAfter such a dominant opening to the year, Button was tipped to secure the crown, however a tough summer saw his tremendous points advantage under attack, with Barrichello and Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel chipping away at his lead.\n\nIt could have all gone down to the very last race of the year, but a stunning drive and more than a little good fortune, ensured Button secured the World Championship in Brazil - becoming the 10th Briton to take the title.\n\nWhile Button was on the road to victory, the 2008 World Champion, Lewis Hamilton, was enduring a tough year as number one - but, characteristically, he dug deep to produce some stunning performances in a car which couldn't match the front-runners for pace.\n\nThe Official 2009 Formula One Review brings you two discs packed with the best edited highlights available from every race, plus previously unseen footage.\n\nEvery key moment from a turbulent season is here, with plenty of breathtaking on-board footage, interviews and exclusive special features taking you up close and personal with all the key players. \n\n\n\nThe Full DVD9 &quot;straight from the Disc&quot;\n\nDetails over the DVD itself: \n\nRunning time: 200 minutes \nPicture: PAL 16:9 \nRegion: 2 \nSound: 5.1 \n\nSeeding: \n\nI will seed this download 24/7 @ 100kB/s for at least the remaining of leechers with my server client. \n\n\nNotice: \n\n- There will be many peers and that might slow the process, don't be scared I will completely upload all the files! \n\nDVD Cover included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d52ceb22138943729b81185726404071a9514f5","amp;dn":"FIA++Formula+1+Season+Review+2009+-++2+Disc+DVD+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d52ceb22138943729b81185726404071a9514f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,82,206,178,33,56,148,55,41,184,17,133,114,100,4,7,26,149,20,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
