Its scenery covers the entire isle with photorealistic textures of a high quality haute qualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, on which each airport has been precisely aligned and enhanced compared to the Flight Simulator 2004 default scenery.\n\nThis scenery also includes a full and specific autogen for the area, and a realistic AI traffic based on real airlines timetables and flight plans. This way, the virtual pilot will enjoy a large flight area in which he can fly both VFR or IFR with an unprecedented realism.\n\nFeatures\n\n    * Reunion Island entirely covered by photorealistic textures\n    * Textures based on IGN aerial photos (not satellite), enhanced for the best visual effect in Flight Simulator.\n    * Summer textures only\n    * Specific Autogen for the area (houses and vegetation) on the whole isle.\n    * Custom Terrain Mesh LOD9/10/11 of a high accuracy for the whole isle.\n    * Coastlines, lakes and streams are faithfully represented and optimized (LWM) with coast flattening (no water ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclimbingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½).
