It brings articles about new and innovative research to the amateur and lay audience.\nScientific American (informally abbreviated to &quot;SciAm&quot;) had a monthly circulation of roughly 555,000 US and 90,000 international as of December 2005. It is a well-respected publication despite not being a peer-reviewed scientific journal, such as Nature; rather, it is a forum where scientific theories and discoveries are explained to a wider audience. In the past scientists interested in fields outside their own areas of expertise made up the magazine's target audience. Now, however, the publication is aimed at educated general readers who are interested in scientific issues. The magazine American Scientist covers similar ground but at a level more suitable for the professional science audience, similar to the older style of Scientific American.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:178b41e4853626f671c654f2a13475fa7d322fcd","amp;dn":"Scientific+American+-+June+2009+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"178b41e4853626f671c654f2a13475fa7d322fcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,139,65,228,133,54,38,246,113,198,84,242,161,52,117,250,125,50,47,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
