It hasn't and for this we're disappointed. They\nare well aware of the problem and haven't fixed it yet. A simple google search of ASAP xvid \nstandalones yields results that every one of their pres has had this problem. Over the last \nfew nights alone we've tested a few of them and none of them work without remuxing to remove \ntheir garbage header data.\n\n\nOne.Tree.Hill.S08E15.HDTV.XviD-ASAP\nSkins.US.S01E05.HDTV.XviD-ASAP\nEpisodes.S01E06.HDTV.XviD-ASAP\nPretty.Little.Liars.S01E16.HDTV.XviD-ASAP\n\nWe provided visual proof last time around and have since heard from people in other groups with other \nstandalones, this combined with the google results proves it is a legit issue and one that shouldn't \nbe allowed to stand. We hoped to have had the support of other leading TV-XVID groups but untill now \nthey've remained quiet. Here's hoping they speak up before it's too late and ASAP has crapped on the XViD \nscene like they have on 720. \n\n\nPS: The cleaniness of a room has nothing to do with the fucking ability to encode a AVI that complies \nwith standalones. But thanks for the cleaning tips ASAP/Immerse leader. We wouldn't hire you or \na cleaning service you run to clean though.\n\n\n\n\n            Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?\n                          &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;583c372b3d292d312b183b2a21282c373539313476372a3f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n                            \n                                                          \n                                                   \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                         \n                                                   \n                          \n                                       \n                                                   \n                                     \n                             \n                         \n                  \n               RESPECT TO        \n        \n       \n       \n         FQM       \n   \n        \n                  2x    \n                        SunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58979379e86c94ee906035fb13f592cca33de16c","amp;dn":"Detroit.1-8-7.S01E15.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58979379e86c94ee906035fb13f592cca33de16c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,151,147,121,232,108,148,238,144,96,53,251,19,245,146,204,163,61,225,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
