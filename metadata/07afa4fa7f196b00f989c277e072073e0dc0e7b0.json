It's a very small (the EXE is only 200KB) but very useful program. It's also easy to use, with only five steps. Easy CD Clone can clone all kinds of CD discs, and the cloned copy would be the same as the original one. The program supports data, audio, video, and other types of CDs. Version 1.1 may include unspecified updates, enhancements, or bug fixes. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07afa4fa7f196b00f989c277e072073e0dc0e7b0","amp;dn":"Easy+CDclone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07afa4fa7f196b00f989c277e072073e0dc0e7b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,175,164,250,127,25,107,0,249,137,194,119,224,114,7,62,13,192,231,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
