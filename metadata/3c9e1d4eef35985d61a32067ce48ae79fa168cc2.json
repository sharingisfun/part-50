Some thinking of me from years ago of how dark energy could be the basis of everything in the univere as we know it. Everything is bases on zero-point particles and everything we see in he physical world is based on swirling connections of intereacting zero-point based particles.\n\nIncluded are two borland c programs written for dos. One is a dynamic newtonian-based model, the other is a einsteinian photo snaphot of black energy.\nBoth can be run using dosbox.\n\nFor everyone to read and to find out if it is interesting and if it may include a part of the truth about everything in the universe as we know it is based on zero-point particles which are infinte in bending of space but have no length, width or height.\n\nIf anyone is interested please give me some comments about this. I do have more programs. One interesting program is written in qbasic showing the distance of electrons swirling an neutron-proton core of an atom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c9e1d4eef35985d61a32067ce48ae79fa168cc2","amp;dn":"dark+energy+as+the+basis+of+the+known+universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c9e1d4eef35985d61a32067ce48ae79fa168cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,158,29,78,239,53,152,93,97,163,32,103,206,72,174,121,250,22,140,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
