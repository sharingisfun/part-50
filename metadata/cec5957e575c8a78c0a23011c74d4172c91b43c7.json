Hiss, crackle, clipping, clicks and fluctuating volume. This has bee properly cleaned, repaired and restored using a combination of hardware and software based filtering. Despite the amount thats been repaired and cleaned, there is almost nothing in the way of quality loss. Its not tinny and its certainly not mumfled. In fact it actualy sounds better not only due to being cleaned so well, but due to additional added effects like stereo widening and eq balencing.\nFyi, this track no longer syncs to visualise's encode but is now synced to the origional dvd. If you mux this wi visualises encode, it will run perminantly 250msc outa sync after aprox the first haf hour. This is due to visualise triming 250msc outa there vid.\n\nI have included a couple of audio comparisons with this torrent. Before clips from visualise's origional track and after clips from the cleaned track. They highlight volume fluctuation correction, hiss crackle and click removal, stereo widening, eq rebalencing etc. Please check and compaire the difference the work has done to the track.\n\nAlso included is a few screenshots of custom subs in action for the debt, shown on media player classic during playback. The whole player, info the works has been captured wi the screenies for technical reasons. Yes peeps av been buisy making custom subs for the loads of non english parts. Expect this to be released, harcoded on our new, better corrected (perspective, angle etc) vid encode, in our v2 in the next couple of days. Meantime, njoy another fine encode from the wizzards at kingdom. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1316489029.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1316489029.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1316489102.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1316489102.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1316489161.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1316489161.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1316489215.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kingdom-kvcd.net/forums/imghost/IMG213172-1316489215.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nthanks to Digideath\n \n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec5957e575c8a78c0a23011c74d4172c91b43c7","amp;dn":"The+Smurfs+2011+R5+LiNE+CLEANED+AUDIO+x264+AAC-KiNGDOM+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec5957e575c8a78c0a23011c74d4172c91b43c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,197,149,126,87,92,138,120,192,162,48,17,199,77,65,114,201,27,67,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
