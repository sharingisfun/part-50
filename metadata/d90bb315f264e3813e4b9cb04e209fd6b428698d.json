This selection is the work I had to do after installing performanceXP. No offence itÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s a very stable and reliable distribution and IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´d rather choose myself in detail what to install, as I did.\n\nHamachi and X.fire isnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t really a basic need for all of you but thay are so small anyway and so powerful. When it comes to gaming some games can be played by you and some friends without connecting to a server. You talk through X-fire (over the game)and play through this old version of Hamachi (remember not to update Hamachi and keep a copy of this one somewhere ;). Maybe there is a better sollution but hey there is always someone somewhere who knows how to be teleported to the moon too ;).\nNotes i wrote in the torrent is in Swedish but an average geek should manage whatever language they speak..\n\nHave a good time and save some time.. with this one.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d90bb315f264e3813e4b9cb04e209fd6b428698d","amp;dn":"PerformanceXP+%2B+quickstart+programs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d90bb315f264e3813e4b9cb04e209fd6b428698d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,11,179,21,242,100,227,129,62,75,156,176,78,32,159,214,180,40,105,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
