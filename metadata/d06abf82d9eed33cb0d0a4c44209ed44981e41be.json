Matthew Perry stars as Alex Whitman, a New Yorker sent to Las Vegas to oversee a construction project. There he meets Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek), and some serious chemistry brings them together for one night. But Alex doesn&amp;#039;t see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes. However, there&amp;#039;s more to marriage than a Vegas chapel and an Elvis impersonator, as Alex and Isabel soon learn.\n\nDirector; Andy Tenant\n\nPAL 1:85\n1997\n105 min\nAudio; English, Spanish, Italian, Dolby digital 5.1\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese.\nCompresion: \nRipit4Me + DVD Remake + DVD Rebuilder HC 2 pass\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 66,7%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4.375Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3.353.564KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 5.115/2.881/4.375 Kbs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d06abf82d9eed33cb0d0a4c44209ed44981e41be","amp;dn":"Fools+rush+in+%28DVD+5+%2F+PAL+%2F+Eng%2C+Spa%2C+Ger%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d06abf82d9eed33cb0d0a4c44209ed44981e41be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,106,191,130,217,238,211,60,176,208,164,196,66,9,237,68,152,30,65,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
