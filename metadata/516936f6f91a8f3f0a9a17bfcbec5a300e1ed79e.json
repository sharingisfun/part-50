It's been just over three years since\nErES was established and in that time in the scene we've produced many\nquality releases because of our attitude not only as a group -- but as\nindividuals; each member of the group has shown respect and friendship\nand in return offers loyalty that could only be found when part of a\ntight-knit family. We are not a release machine and never intend to be\nWe have a relaxed, yet hard-working attitude towards producing releases\nand you can see this through all of our current (and future) releases\n\nIf you feel ErES is a family that you want to be part of\nwe have listed below the currently open positions and things we\nrequire:\n\nExperienced reversers for all Operating Systems;\nSkilled coders;\nQuality suppliers;\nGood 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with;\nAnything else you think we might like!\n\ne r e s g r p a t g m a i l . c o m\n\nascii/nfo:...........ph0!SiLK updated:............16.04.2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:516936f6f91a8f3f0a9a17bfcbec5a300e1ed79e","amp;dn":"Angry.Birds.Seasons.v2.0.0.Cracked.GAME-ErES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"516936f6f91a8f3f0a9a17bfcbec5a300e1ed79e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,105,54,246,249,26,143,63,10,154,23,191,203,236,90,48,14,30,215,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
