Shimizu demonstrates his deceptively facile adeptness and virtuoso camerawork through a series of extraordinarily choreographed plan sequence shots: a track-and-field race around the campus track between the school&amp;#039;s start athlete Seki (Shuji Sano) and his constantly spurring - and sparring - team mate (Chishu Ryu); an extended dolly sequence of the students&amp;#039; march as bemused villagers and flirtatious, love-struck young women alternately respectfully step aside, playfully trail, obliviously obstruct, and amorously chase the dashing students in uniform; a mock battlefield charge assault through muddy fields as a guilt-ridden motley crew of travelers on the road scramble to flee from the students in a mistaken belief of being chased in retribution for their petty transgressions during their brief stay in the village.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/sa1-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/sa1-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/sa2-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/sa2-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/sa3-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk75/otr2damascus/sa3-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----my rip---\n\nsource: ADC\n\ncredits:\nglynford for providing both the hardsubbed vhs rip used for transcribing the english subs, as well as an unsubbed vhs to dvd copy of the film to use for the custom dvd.\ngleemonex: transcription of english subs from hardsubbed vhs, timing and syncing of subtitles and dvd creation.\n\n~~~~~~ Hanagata senshu.avi ~~~~~~\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................777,304,064\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:03:33\nFrame Count:....................................91413\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................624\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................464\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.345\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1429\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.206&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
