Mr. Wood worked with the late Antony Sutton on a highly regarded two-volume book, Trilaterals Over Washington, that became a standard reference on global elitism. Alex also talks with F. Michael Maloof, staff writer for WND and a former senior security policy analyst in the office of the Secretary of Defense. Mr. Maloof talks about Obama's purge of the military. Alex talks about Obamacare, the NSA and other topics with computer programmer and founder of McAfee, Inc., John McAfee.\n\nNOTE: Today's show consists entirely of previously aired material from broadcasts in recent weeks.\n\nThis upload is the Prison Planet &quot;members' edit,&quot; which has the commercials during scheduled breaks removed and the entire show in one MP3 file.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
