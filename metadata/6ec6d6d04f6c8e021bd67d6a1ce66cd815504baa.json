I am amazed that people dont know about compression utilities. They have been around since computers were being sold. Yes even the commodore 64 and those before them had them and professional software companies paid large sums of money to use them so they could fit those 150KB programs onto those peskly 120KB disks. WINXP has a built in ZIP handler but not for RAR format. So you have to google and get 7ZIP which handles almost all of them and it is free from sourceforge. The 700MB AVI file is compressed and split up to make transfers easy and to verify file integrity. You dont think in this day and age there are transmission errors? When there is no human intervention from release to distribution, you need things like this so that John Henry can know when something is kaput and try to fix it. ZIP format has been around since the late 80's before video hence it is not so good at compressing it as RAR or 7ZIP is.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA teenage girl risks everything when she falls in love with a vampire\n\nand for out next presentation brought to you by playboy_88\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4533557/Changeling.2008.TELESYNC.XViD-PUKKA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4533557/Changeling.2008.TELESYNC.XViD-PUKKA&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec6d6d04f6c8e021bd67d6a1ce66cd815504baa","amp;dn":"Twilight+CAM+XViD+CAMERA%C3%82%C2%AE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec6d6d04f6c8e021bd67d6a1ce66cd815504baa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,198,214,208,79,108,142,2,27,214,125,106,28,230,108,216,21,80,75,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
