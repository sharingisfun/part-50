This is the first revision of the forth release of the distribution. As the version number suggests, it is based on Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope. As with all previous releases, 9.04.01 has been built from scratch using the Ubuntu MinimalCD. The builds were completed on the 6th July 2009 and contain all security and package updates available at the time from the Ubuntu repositories. \nWhat's new?\n\nFor the first time, CrunchBang Linux is available to download in both 32 and 64-bit builds. The addition of the 64-bit (amd64) builds were a major contributing factor to the delay of this release, although the end result was worth the extra development time. Other noticeable changes as a result of moving to the latest stable Ubuntu release include: \nMuch improved boot performance with faster start-up times.\nImproved support for wireless cards.\nExt4 filesystem support.\n\nOther changes over the previous 8.10.02 release have been kept to a minimum, with the exception of: \nThe lightweight tint2 panel/taskbar replaces lxpanel.\nTransmission BitTorrent client replaces Deluge.\nA full Vim installation included by default.\nPyroom fullscreen editor included by default.\nMany other minor tweaks and fixes including:\nImproved documentation added to default configuration files.\nOpenbox menu items added for commonly used configuration files.\nNew and improved default Openbox and GTK themes.\nAdditional Openbox and GTK+ themes installed, including the popular Dyne themes.\nDownload locations\n\nPlease see the CrunchBang Linux 9.04.01 downloads page for download locations and alternative installations methods. \nKnown Issues\n\nCrunchBang is built using many base packages provided by Ubuntu, therefore it inherits some known issues.
