The investigation shows that the Solid Rocket Booster field joints were of an insufficiently fault-tolerant design and when the vehicle was launched at below-normal temperatures, hot exhaust gasses leaked on ignition, damaging the integrity of the field joint, leading to a breach in the external tank and destruction of the orbiter.\n\nWatch this video as Stream:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://opencast.de/?p=779&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://opencast.de/?p=779&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMore interesting content on www.opencast.de\n\n\n\nThis video is in the Public Domain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4172ba0492e812a02b1d5e73c45dbb335804947d","amp;dn":"Video+-+Space+Shuttle+Challenger+Accident+Investigation+%281986%29+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4172ba0492e812a02b1d5e73c45dbb335804947d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,114,186,4,146,232,18,160,43,29,94,115,196,93,187,51,88,4,148,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
