Mostly high-res scans. Items in /Michele Light/ should all be organized by title. May not be complete with all their recent works, but more organized than other folders. 400mb total.\n\n/Terrie Smith &amp; Michelle Light - Cats and Dogs/: Scans of the publication &quot;cats and dogs.&quot; May not be complete. 1.5mb.\n\n/Terrie Smith and Michelle Light [7chan]/, /Terrie Smith and Michelle Light [lulz, Mobiuswolf]/: Contents of imageboard threads containing work by these two artists. Quality varies wildly. No organization. More likely to contain rescans and other similar-yet-unidentical copies of pictures. 760mb total.\n\nSome of this material is available for direct download, get it while it lasts.
