Doom 3, despite its name, is not a direct continuation of the original Doom series storyline, but rather a re imagining of the first game in the series, with the addition of a completely new game engine and graphics.\n\nSet in the year 2145 in a fictional Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research center on Mars, Doom 3 has the player take control of an anonymous marine as he fights to survive a mysterious invasion of inter-dimensional demons. In the process, the marine learns more about the nature of the shadowy research being conducted within the massive base and its main instigator, Dr. Malcolm Betruger.\n\nDoom 3 was developed for Windows and ported to Linux in 2004; seven months later, it was also released for Mac OS X (ported by Aspyr) and Xbox (co-developed by Vicarious Visions). The Xbox version is graphically similar to the original, although less detailed. It also features an additional two-player online co-operation mode. An expansion, Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil, developed by Nerve Software and co-developed by id Software, was released on April 4, \n2005. The Xbox version of Doom 3 is an Xbox 360-compatible title, and the Xbox version of Resurrection of Evil is also backwards compatible as of July 2007. A Doom movie, loosely based on the franchise, was released roughly six months later on October 21, 2005.\n\nThis release has been distributed to update the precious Doom 3 Co-op Federation release. This release consists of three completely portable dedicated servers and  clients. The severs are Doom 3: Ecoop, Doom 3, and Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil. This release possesses several advantages over its predecessors, including more  modded content (eCoop 2), better frame rates (on most computers), the inclusion of pre-cracked DLL and PK4 files and through said cracks a radical reduction on size. This release allows the creation of pre-modded and cracked dedicated servers for the main campaign and its expansion, thereby allowing up to four players to play cooperatively through the Resurrection of Evil campaign or the main Doom 3 campaign on varying difficulties through an internet or LAN configuration.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to your computer through the trial of this game. This mod has been tested to work \non Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this release took many hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nThe cooperative multiplayer functionality of this release were made by the community at Doom III open Coop (http://www.d3opencoop.com/) who neither support nor condone piracy. The Federation released their work without their permission.\n.III.\nThis game can work on single player featuring &quot;Doom 3 &amp; Doom 3: RoE&quot; or through \nthe coop mod. The two functions cannot be played simultaneously.\n.IV.\nThe &quot;CD key issue&quot; has been solved through the creation of content based on an UNLIMITED crack.\n.V.\nTo all the Fans, Friends, Foes, Members and Affiliates, of the FEDERATION:\n\n\t\t\t-----------------------\n\t\t\t|THANKS FOR EVERYTHING| \n                        -----------------------\n\nBecause of you we are &quot;STILL UNDERGROUND&quot; and &quot;STILL ALIVE&quot;.\n[54686f73652057686f204b6e6f772055732043616e2046696e64205573]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;Doom 3 - Ultimate Co-op.rar&quot; and then Navigate to the &quot;Doom 3 - Co-op&quot; directory. Double-click on the &quot;Doom3_Shortcuts.exe&quot; program. This program is not necessary as it only installs shortcuts (makes no changes to the game files which are already updated, modded, and cracked).\n\n(2.) Click through the installation instructions. Make certain that you install \nthe shortcut program to the &quot;Doom 3 - Co-op&quot; directory.\n\n(3.) Open the desired shortcut (which by default is) located on your desktop to \nstart the game.\n\n\nShortcut Information:\n\n&quot;Doom 3 Dedicated Server&quot;             - Doom 3 Server Hosting\n&quot;Doom 3 Client&quot;                       - Doom 3 Single/Multi Gameplay\n&quot;Doom 3 eCo-op Dedicated Server&quot;      - Doom 3 Enhanced Server Hosting\n&quot;Doom 3 eCo-op Client&quot;                - Doom 3 Enhanced Single/Multi Gameplay\n&quot;Doom 3 ROE Dedicated Server&quot;         - Doom 3 ROE Server Hosting\n&quot;Doom 3 ROE Client&quot;                   - Doom 3 ROE Single/Multi Gameplay\n\nNote: The official manuals, and game covers are located in the &quot;..DOOM 3 - Co-opExtras&quot; directory.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and roms in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like this one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nHalf Life Decay Co-op - The Decay Team\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nWe are currently waiting for the Decay Team to release their Beta port (long \noverdue).

Once they have a clean version working, this Crack-Mod will be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their work there is no release date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Recent Releases\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFarCry Co-op - Assault/Campaign Co-op   |Quake II Ultimate Co-op - COOP or DIE\t\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete \nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete \nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete \nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete \nURL   -\thttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n3791203\t \t\t\t\t|3792230/Quake_II_Ultimate_COOP_or_DIE_\n\nHalf Life Opposing Force - Hlcoop Clan \t|Sonic Comics Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Lib   - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|3933117/Sonic_Comics_Collection\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|\n3795267/Half-Life_Opposing_Force_\t|\nUltimate_Co-op  \t\t\t|\n\nRoxio Easy Media Creator\t \t|Vampire Masquerade:Ultimate Bloodlines\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t|\nApp   - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\t\t\t\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|Test  - Complete\n3938149/ Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_Suite_|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n10_Multilanguage (Final)\t\t|4218464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop FINAL* |Half-Life Ultimate Co-op - Sven FINAL* \n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4218|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/42\n464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)\t|36344/Half-Life_Ultimate__Co-op_%5BInc\n\t\t\t\t        |ludes_Blue_Shift__amp__Opposing_Force%\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Known Problems\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1.)
