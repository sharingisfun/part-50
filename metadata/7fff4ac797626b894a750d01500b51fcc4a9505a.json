Even the sleeve pictures reflect the schizophrenia; on the front they are laughing in red and white stage uniforms, decorations round their necks and covered in flashes and the letter &quot;M&quot;, on the reverse they are more moody, clad in denim on fog-bound stone steps. The album itself displays progressive touches both lyrically and musically on the first three tracks, particularly Taking Part and Gettin' Involved. From track four onwards the album is a more straight-forward rocking affair, sounding a little like Sweet in places especially on (by coincidence) Sweet Sweet Cheatin' Rita. This is one of the two songs on the album jointly written by Roger Greenaway, who also produced. Elsewhere the songs are mainly band compositions. It's only a guess, but one gets the impression of the band coming from a prog direction, getting a record deal, and going all out for a hit with Cook and Greenaway production values.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fff4ac797626b894a750d01500b51fcc4a9505a","amp;dn":"Merlin-Merlin-Vinylrip-320-Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fff4ac797626b894a750d01500b51fcc4a9505a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,255,74,199,151,98,107,137,74,117,13,1,80,11,81,252,196,169,80,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
