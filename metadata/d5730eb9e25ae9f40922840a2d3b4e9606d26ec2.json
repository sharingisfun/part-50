Eight of the 15 tracks are Fagan/Brecker compositions interpreted by some of pop music's front line.\n\nThe Foo Fighters open the set with their trademark uplifting aggro-pop while Smashmouth sets a quirky tone with its So-Cal &quot;Walking on the Sun&quot;-ified version of &quot;Do it Again.&quot; Third Eye Blind's latest power ballad makes a soundtrack guest appearance with &quot;Deep Inside of You.&quot; The Offspring submit a faithful rendition of A.F.I.'s &quot;Totalimmortal,&quot; while Ellis Paul offers the radio-ready &quot;The World Ain't Slowin' Down.&quot; Wilco has the perfect Fender Rhodes-spiced touch on &quot;Any Major Dude Will Tell You,&quot; and Ivy injects technology into &quot;Only a Fool Would Say That.&quot; Hootie &amp; The Blowfish sport big harmonies on &quot;Can't Find the Time to Tell You,&quot; and the brass powerhouse and hollow-body guitar sound of the Brian Setzer Orchestra puts an interesting spin on &quot;Bodhisattva.&quot; Pop rockers Marvelous 3 add a hard rock edge to the classic &quot;Reelin' in the Years,&quot; while Ben Folds Five make &quot;Barrytown&quot; their own.\n\nNeedless to say, this mini-tribute album often fails to improve on the indelible originals, mostly because the singers fail to keep one eyebrow raised as Dan frontman Donald Fagen did so perfectly. Still, Wilco leader Jeff Tweedy's hoarseness and Ivy chanteuse Dominique Durand's sweet bite complement the sentiments of &quot;Any Major Dude Will Tell You&quot; and &quot;Only a Fool Would Say That,&quot; respectively, while power-poppers Marvelous 3 have the right idea in cranking their amps for &quot;Reelin' in the Years.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing &amp; Personnel\n\n01.
