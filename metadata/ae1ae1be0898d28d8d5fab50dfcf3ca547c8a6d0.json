Whether it be actually recorded back then...or a new live recording by a band who touches on that certain sound. The Dream Clinic features music which for some unknown reason has fallen through the cracks and has never been explored on the typical commercial radio shows.\n\nThe show has its roots in a fellow named Tony Cona who started a late night show on WMNF called The Dream Clinic after a radio skit he and friends did. That was 1985. Later my friend Mark Kraemer hosted the show for about 7 years by himself...4 hours at a time each week. I started somewhere around 1993 volunteering for duty at community radio station WMNF...shortly thereafter met Mark and found we had a lot in common musically. In the last 15 years several people have been involved with the show..Mike Slosberg, Jim Orr, Walter Storch, Mark Kraemer and myself..Dennis Stone. For about the last 10 years it has been my project...keeping the Dream Flame alive!\n\nWe've gone through WMNF timeslots from the &quot;So Late Its Actually Early&quot; 2am-6am shows...to 3 different evening shows..Monday, Tuesday and now for the last few years...Wednesday 7-9pm EST.\n\nIt is designed to be a weekly listen...something different each week...progressive, psychedelic, bluesrock, rare albums, live recordings, hard rock (remember hard rock before metal came along??)...lots of computer editing the sounds...never know what you might hear on The Dream Clinic!!\n\nPlaylists and the weekly replay may be found at www.wmnf.org\n\nThanks for Listening to what I have to play.....\n\nDennis Stone\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0d697f686c606e616463646e4d6c6261236e6260&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nalso on Facebook if you are there! \n\nDream Clinic Playlist for March 04, 2009\nArtist -- Track -- Album/CD \nSHOW INTRO\nJ RIDER -- KISS OF YOUR SOUL -- J RIDER NO LONGER ANONYMOUS \nJ RIDER -- PIKE RIVER -- J RIDER NO LONGER ANONYMOUS \nJ RIDER -- HIGH ROLLER -- J RIDER NO LONGER ANONYMOUS \nSET BREAK\nPEANUT BUTTER CONSPIRACY--TURN ON A FRIEND--TOO MANY DO\nPEANUT BUTTER CONSPIRACY--TURN ON A FRIEND--LIVING LOVING LIFE\nSET BREAK\nLACEWING--S/T--PARADOX\nLACEWING--S/T--TIME TO GO\nLACEWING--S/T--UNKNOWN TITLE??\nSET BREAK\nTHE BEATLES--STUDIO OUT TAKE--REVOLUTION\nJOE BYRD AND THE FIELD HIPPIES--AMERICAN METAPHYSICAL CIRCUS--KALYANI/YOU CAN'T EVER COME DOWN\nSUSAN CHRISTIE--PAINT A LADY--YESTERDAY, WHERE'S MY MIND?\nSET BREAK\nFIVE DAY RAIN--S/T--DON'T BE MISLEAD BY WHAT I'VE SAID\nFIVE DAY RAIN--S/T--ROUGH CUT MARMALADE\nFUSION ORCHESTRA--SKELETONS IN ARMOUR--SONATA IN Z\nSET BREAK\nGALAXY--DAY WITHOUT THE SUN--DAY WITHOUT THE SUN\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae1ae1be0898d28d8d5fab50dfcf3ca547c8a6d0","amp;dn":"THE+DREAM+CLINIC+RADIO+SHOW+2009-03-04+FLAC+PROGRESSIVE+ROCK%2C+PS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae1ae1be0898d28d8d5fab50dfcf3ca547c8a6d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,26,225,190,8,152,210,141,141,95,171,80,223,207,60,165,71,200,166,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
