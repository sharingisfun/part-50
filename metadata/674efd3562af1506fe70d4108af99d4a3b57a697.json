Also i'll appreciate any ideas for making this tool more efficient and funny smile.gif\n\n\n\nWhat is it?\nThis is a small asi loader plugin, which allows you to use some funny functions via GUI.\n\n\nHow it works?\nThis tool hooks game via Alexander's Blade asi loader and calls game's native functions only. No memory addresses, no need for xlive wrapper.\n\n\nHow to get it work?\nJust unpack files into GTA root directory and... thats all. All you need next is launch the game, load your save and when you see Niko on the screen - ALT+TAB and set all you want to. Setting values before Niko appears is leading to the game crashes.\n\n\nWhat will I get?\n\n1) Time of day settings: here you can set desired time of day - so dont need to carry about mission timeouts and also you can get directly to the dusk/dawn time to watch game's sunrises.\n\n2) Weather settings: simply select the weather you like and set it! No more rain or any othe FPS and mood killer! Let it be sunshine!\n\n3) Player coordinates: this shows your Niko's current position. I'm hardly working on this now and soon I hope you will get more interesting options here.\n\n4) Give weapons: press this button to give Niko some weapons. Note that not all of them will appear in Niko's hands cause some of them are using the same slots. To get the specific weapon use Give weapon dropdown option described below.\n\n5) Give ammo: refulls the ammo for all Niko's weapons.\n\n6)Set health: set Niko's health. Refulls current health and sets it to the specified limit.\n\n7)Wanted level: this option is on test. Dont set any level if you doesnt have any already. You need at least one police star to use this option. WIP.\n\n8) Set money: sets Niko's money.\n\n9) Super stamina (Alt + Numeric 0): this is the toogle option. Niko never gets tired when enabled.\n\n10) Invincible (Alt + Numeric 1): Niko is invincible when enabled.\n\n11) Stupid police (Alt + Numeric 2): look at this option ingame\n\n12)Never wanted (Alt + Numeric 3): toogle/untoogle to set Niko never wanted by police.\n\n13)Tank mode (Alt + Numeric 4): toogle/untoogle to set Niko's car be never damaged.\n\n14)No gravity (Alt + Numeric 5): toogle/untoogle to switch global gravity.\n\n15) Give weapon: select the specific weapon from the list and press Give weapon button. Niko will receive a weapon gift.\n\n16) Set car color: select the specific color from the list and press Set color. This option sets Niko's car color.\n\nPS: You can set options 9-14 ON/OFF on your desire.\n\nPS2: Hotkey Alt+F1 forces Invincible mode for Niko do not lose  it after cutscenes. maybe it can eat CPU so use it on your own decision instead of normal Invincible option.\n\nIMPORTANT: tested only on the patched GTA IV and only in singleplayer game. I dont know whether this tool works for non-pathed game and MP, its on your own risk.\n\nSpecial thanks to Alexander Blade and listener for their asi loader and help. Thanks impossiblex for using his premiumaccount.\n\nICQ: 225051918\ne-mail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a5c1d0c4c9c6cad7c08bc6cacbd6d1e5c2c8c4ccc98bc6cac8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \ndualCore (c) 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:674efd3562af1506fe70d4108af99d4a3b57a697","amp;dn":"GTA+IV+Trainer+%28dualcore%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"674efd3562af1506fe70d4108af99d4a3b57a697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,78,253,53,98,175,21,6,254,112,212,16,138,249,157,74,59,87,166,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
