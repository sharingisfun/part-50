ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as though he distilled the entire catalog of LPs, EPs, splits, solo-projects and the rest to a single lyric, and if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit of self-reflection from the band Ã¢â‚¬â€ the lineup of the trio completed by bassist/vocalist Mikey Allred (also synth, Mellotron, trombone) and drummer Casey Perry Ã¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accompanied by a corresponding self-reliance. In addition to releasing the 180 gram gatefold vinyl themselves, Olson and Allred also helmed the recording, and Perry built and photographed the model for the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover, and their know-how is no less prevalent in terms of their songwriting and aesthetic than it is in the practicalities of pressing and releasing. Nearly a decade on from getting together, Across Tundras have constructed a niche almost entirely their own of Americana-infused heavy psychedelic rock, richly ambient and reliant particularly in the case of Electric Relics on a pervasive sense of open space within the material. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true of the wistful, tonally-weighted sway enacted by Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pining for the Gravel RoadsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and remains the uniting factor of the otherwise deeply varied work through to the Spaghetti Western gallop that closes the side B finale Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unfortunate Son.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Whatever they want to do with their sound, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the process down at this point and they know how to tie it together for a full-length flow. In just under 41 minutes, Electric Relics engages a flurry of ideals, both idolizing an unknowable past and seeking to create something whole and new from it. \n- See more at: http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2013/07/11/across-tundras-electric-relics-review/#sthash.36mF2moh.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf37340071ef234e532e4b82f1982f030569f7bd","amp;dn":"ACROSS+TUNDRAS+-+Electric+Relics+-+2013+%28320kbps+mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf37340071ef234e532e4b82f1982f030569f7bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,55,52,0,113,239,35,78,83,46,75,130,241,152,47,3,5,105,247,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
