However, the odd coupling of micro-house with electro-pop on Pain Disappears makes it an unlikely choice for the imprintÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first ever artist album. Until you consider that Fly boss Ben Watt established himself as Tracey ThornÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s other half in Everything But The Girl, admired as much for their romantic pop sensibility as their dancefloor friendliness. This is what Rex Club resident Caroline Laher and fellow Paris DJ Garcia seek to emulate, right down to the question marks over the true nature of their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcollaborationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. But while the intensely private Thorn and Watt are now confirmed married with kids, if Caroline and Franck were ever an item, they certainly arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t any more.\n\nPain Disappears reveals the death of a relationship, which, as always, takes place behind closed doors. The outward signs suggest everything is fine: the wistful single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Always YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and the Ewan Pearson mix that tugged our heart strings late last year; the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s happy-ever-after title; even its production presents a united front. Caro and Garcia share vocal duties throughout, singing every line side by side as if they were one being. (Granted, a being that can't really sing, but they're carrying on the great French tradition of vocalists whose accent far outweighs their ability, from Serge Gainsbourg to Miss Kittin.) The coupleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s double-edged voice is supported by instruments that chime in together, like the twin guitars of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Dead SoulsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, which reinforce this atmosphere of absolute harmony. But the lyrics tell a different storyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\n\nWell, all i can say is that Buddha Bar used parts of this CD in their last release ( Buddha Bar IX )\nThey arent well known but my advice is listen to this cd its amazing ...\n\nPlease Seed\nZouz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66bf01939ac0fb1502cb2a279a1d8ca60a8fb925","amp;dn":"Mlle+Caro+%26+Franck+Garcia+By+Zouz+%28+Very+Rare+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66bf01939ac0fb1502cb2a279a1d8ca60a8fb925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,191,1,147,154,192,251,21,2,203,42,39,154,29,140,166,10,143,185,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
