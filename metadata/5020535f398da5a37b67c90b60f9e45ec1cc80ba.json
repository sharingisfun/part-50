This gives you greater privacy, security, network speed, connectivity and anonymity.\n\nJust use the 'Setup Relaying' button on the Vidalia Control Panel to select what types of traffic and how much traffic you want to relay!\n \n- Torpark2 turns any internet terminal into an anonymous connection and uses a secure, privacy focused web browser, Mozilla Firefox. It requires no installation or further configuration or technical knowledge. It can be used on portable media such as a USB flash drive or any hard disk drive.\n \nWith Torpark2 security online isn't complicated. The software is designed to be intuitive and as easy to use as any other web browser. A secure and encrypted connection to the Tor network is created from any computer, whether your at home, work or in a public location, such as an internet cafe. The browser clears all data that was created on the drive upon exit or on demand.\n \nThis new 2008 version is a rebuild of the popular 'Torpark' - v2.0.0.3a, released in 2006. It later became the 'xB Browser' by 'Xerobank'.\n\nTorpark2 is faster and more secure than previous versions of 'Torpark' and is packed with new features and upgraded addons.\n\nTorpark2 is a combination of free and open source software's. It will never be charged for. It's small, portable and free of spyware, adware, malware and viruses.\n\nOriginal 'Torpark' by Steve Topletz, portions by John T.
