The conversations heard in the film have never before been made public and they reveal a highly personal portrait of an artist much discussed but not particularly well understood.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790769/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790769/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- my first torrent for the pirate bay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:814f5949f6d9f82e2ab5fc9486c16ff96e4a7862","amp;dn":"Kurt+Cobain+-+About+A+Son+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"814f5949f6d9f82e2ab5fc9486c16ff96e4a7862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,79,89,73,246,217,248,46,42,181,252,148,134,193,111,249,110,74,120,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
