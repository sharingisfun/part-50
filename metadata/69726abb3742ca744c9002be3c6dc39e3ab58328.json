He returned for another month of performances in early 1970. A number of the songs from 1969 formed the live disc of the two record set From Memphis To Vegas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ From Vegas to Memphis which was released during the fall of 1969 plus ten songs from the 1970 shows were released as On Stage during June of 1970. The albums were commercially successful receiving gold and platinum sales awards respectively.\n\nRCA/Legacy has now combined this series of concerts into a two CD set. Each disc contains an original album plus bonus tracks. The sound has been scrubbed and cleaned and a booklet with photos plus a three thousand word essay gives a history of the performances and the albums.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc One ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ On Stage\n01.
