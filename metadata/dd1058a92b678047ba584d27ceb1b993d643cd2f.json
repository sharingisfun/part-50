Please share it with everyone you know!\nWe really want you to hear this music alot more than we want to \nmake money off of it.  This is our little way of showing that we\nsupport file sharing, especially because it empowers independent\nmusicians to get their music out there to anyone who wants to hear\nit, even if they don't really want to shell out extra cash for it!\n\nPlease, take the time to visit our myspace or our website, drop us\na line, let us know that you're out there and that you're listening!\nWe are always recording new songs, and even though the quality isn't\nas good as it could be, we're doing the best we can with what gear\nwe have for now.  So if you're annoyed with all the compression in the\nsongs, it really is because they sound alot better with the compression\nbecause it's hiding alot of the little flaws :)\n\nThank you so much for listening and taking the time to download this!\nPlease visit us and let us know what you think!  You never know, we may\nbe able to come play a show for you in your town :)\n\nThanks again!\n\n\t-Jym Pagel (Lead Vocals, songwriter, piano, guitars, synthesizers)\n\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\nmyspace /openlettermusic\n*http://www.openlettermusic.net\n\n\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST\n\n1 - Intro\n2 - Strong Enough\n3 - Swollen\n4 - On My Mind\n5 - Grey Convertible\n6 - After Me\n7 - Stealing Your Identity\n8 - Wander\n9 - Take Your Time\n10- Shattered\n11- Disappear\n12- Goodnight (live)\n13- Fortunate Son (Creedence Clearwater Revival Cover)\n\n\n\n\nYou can also download this CD in a .ZIP folder at http://www.openlettermusic.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd1058a92b678047ba584d27ceb1b993d643cd2f","amp;dn":"GREAT+band%21++Really+catchy%2C+awesome+CD+-+Open+Letter+%28Houston%2C+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd1058a92b678047ba584d27ceb1b993d643cd2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,16,88,169,43,103,128,71,186,88,77,39,206,177,185,147,214,67,205,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
