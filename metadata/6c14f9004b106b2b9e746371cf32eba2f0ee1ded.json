The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.\n\nOn this Sunday, June 8 Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Dan Feidt, who posted a U.S. Army Civil Disturbance Operations training course document instructing soldiers to break up &quot;unauthorized gatherings&quot; by &quot;dissident elements&quot; in the United States. The course material also calls for confiscating weapons. \n\nAlex also talks about his latest video, Humanity's Greatest Secret: Dreams of the Universe. The video describes how mankind is at a crossroads and humanity faces a decision: embrace the dreams of the universe and the fact that humanity is special and has potential, or succumb to the death of domination by a predatory elite bent on wrecking the species and limiting the paradigms of the mind.\n\n\nHe has fixed the portion of the video as it was aired Friday night on the Infowars Nightly News where he was referring to Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet,&quot; but was calling him &quot;Macbeth.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c14f9004b106b2b9e746371cf32eba2f0ee1ded","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2012+July+08+SU+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c14f9004b106b2b9e746371cf32eba2f0ee1ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,20,249,0,75,16,107,43,158,116,99,113,207,50,235,162,240,238,29,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
