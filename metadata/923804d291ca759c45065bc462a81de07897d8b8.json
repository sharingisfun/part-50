If you remember KTOY because I left Washington in 1979 and went to live in Great Britain for the next 2 yrs so what happened to KTOY 91.7 FM in 1978 the University of WA seattle Huskies won the Rose Bowl I am still a Husky fan. Also remember the real &quot;House Party's&quot; in Tacoma and Seattle back in 1978 &amp; I saw my first concert in Tacoma KC and the Sunshine band. Dixie Lee Ray was WA first lady Governor I was there. And my CloverPark HS yearbook was the KLAHOWYA\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was enrolled at L.H. Bates Voc.-Tech. in '83 / '84, as a student of the Radio Broadcasting class.\nI never got farther than reading the news on the air, but still tell people stories of those days.\nWe were Top-40 back then.\nEven though the school was closed from 3pm Friday, until 7 or 8 am Monday, the &quot;Station Manager&quot; allowed students to continue running the station on the weekends, ONLY if an &quot;official&quot; PD were present on-site.\nBy the time I was there, this was almost like &quot;just another part of the course&quot;.\nTHIS was when the Hip-Hop (or &quot;R&amp;B&quot; as we called it, back then) was played, otherwise it was Top-40 radio.\nMany remember our &quot;signature&quot; as &quot;KTOY, 91.7 FM. R&amp;B's best, in the Pacific Northwest&quot;.\nI think I actually recorded one of those signatures for use on the weekend.\nHere's a tidbit - back then, an RTO license was...FREE! You just signed up at the post office.\nIt allowed you to talk on the air, and blow dust off the tape heads or record needles (yes, you read that right!). Otherwise, a licensed engineer had to twist knobs for you.\nYou needed a General Class License to twist your own knobs.\nI was part of the class that took the last GCL test given in Seattle. April, 1984.\nBy then it was a formality and it didn't really matter if you passed or not, because it was going away (thank you, Ronald Regan). They gave one more in Spokane, a few weeks later.\nNow, the RTO permit is like $40, last I heard.\n\n=============================================================================\nSLOW DOWNLOAD SPEED?
