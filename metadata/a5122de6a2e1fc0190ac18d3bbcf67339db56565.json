As much as it can be a compliment, no artist likes to be told they sound like another; but by now Brad has come to terms with it. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt used to bother me, I took it as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“hey youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a crappy Beck impersonator with no ideas of your own!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ But other musicians told me they get compared to Beck all the time also. So maybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the musical equivalent of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“tastes like chickenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. The guyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s done so much in many different styles itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to compare nearly anything to something in his catalog.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
