Bridging Cuckoo and Come Clean in terms of sound, &quot;Pink Girl with the Blues&quot; is one of Curve's greatest moments, just as pumping and charging as &quot;On the Wheel&quot; or &quot;Coast Is Clear.&quot; &quot;Recovery&quot; is a dark, menacing track that ended up becoming an excellent closer on 1998's Come Clean. Though a strong track, one has to wonder why it ended up on the full length while &quot;Pink Girl&quot; didn't. The midtempo, percolating &quot;Black Delilah&quot; sounds like an outtake from Cuckoo, which surprisingly isn't a bad thing. \n\n01 Pink Girl with the Blues (4:17)\n02 Recovery (4:34)\n03 Black Delilah (4:54)\n\n-----\n\nFrom Cuckoo's Nest, The Curve Archive:\n\nCURVE. &quot;PINK GIRL WITH THE BLUES&quot;\n\nAll tracks Produced by Dean Garcia and Toni Halliday.
