I recorded it off the World Service\nten or so years back, but it's much older than that.\nCoded from tape at 128/44.1\n\nFrankenstein type fantasy in which a prole's heart is grafted\ninto a mongrel dog which then attacks its masters ... loosely\nhidden attack on the way the Russian Revolution was turning out.\n\nFortunately for Bulgakov, Stalin could stand a certain amount\nof criticism from artists.
