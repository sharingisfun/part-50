Well those problems will be lessen with this mod(not completely but you'll notice the different).\n\nThis mod is not mine, I just saw it somewhere on the net and though that it would be useful. The original moder who made this mod is MonochromeWench.\n\nInstruction:\n\nFirst, make sure Steam is running. Then run Skyrim4GB.exe to launch the game! \nYou don't even need it in the games directory, just make sure skyrim4gb.exe and\nskyrim4gb_helper.dll are together.\n\nIf your version of Skyrim is not the standard version with the\nSteamAppID of 72850 you need to run Skyrim4gb.exe and specify the actual \nSteamAppID on the command line. Example: Skyrim4gb.exe 72850\n\n\n\nHappy gaming:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a773b89d85d22bbac3d399e14d5c25d14f1c366e","amp;dn":"Play+Skyrim+with+4GB+ram.%21+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a773b89d85d22bbac3d399e14d5c25d14f1c366e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,115,184,157,133,210,43,186,195,211,153,225,77,92,37,209,79,28,54,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
