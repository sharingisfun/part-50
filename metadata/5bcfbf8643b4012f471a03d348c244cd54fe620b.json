Also one word in the first verse is censored.\n\n\n\n&quot;Smile&quot; is Lily Allen's first mainstream single release, and was penned by Lily Allen, Iyola Babalola and Darren Lewis (the duo who produced the track as Future Cut). The organ riff is a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on &quot;Free Soul&quot; by The Soul Brothers, written by Jackie Mittoo.\n\nThe song was certified Gold by the RIAA on February 9, 2009, selling over 500,000 copies.\n\nThe music video, directed by Sophie Muller (who also directed the video of previous UK number-one &quot;Hips Don't Lie&quot; by Shakira), shows Allen getting revenge on an ex-boyfriend (played by Elliott Jordan) who cheated on her. She pays some thugs to beat him up, then takes him to a cafe to console him while the thugs trash his apartment and scratch his vinyl records. At the cafe, she puts laxatives in his coffee so he gets diarrhoea. Later, as a result of the laxatives, he has to come to her house to use the toilet as his has been blocked by the thugs. The video finishes with Allen walking down the street smiling while the ex-boyfriend is DJing in a nightclub only to find that all his vinyl records have been scratched. Allen commented in an interview that the video was banned on MTV because it contained mugging. It also has a profanity in its first verse; the offending lyric 'But you were fucking that girl next door' is censored in some releases, but present in others. &quot;I got really offended when my single, Smile, got banned from MTV in the UK because it had the word fuck in it!&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bcfbf8643b4012f471a03d348c244cd54fe620b","amp;dn":"Lily+Allen+-+Smile","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bcfbf8643b4012f471a03d348c244cd54fe620b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,207,191,134,67,180,1,47,71,26,3,211,72,194,68,205,84,254,98,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
