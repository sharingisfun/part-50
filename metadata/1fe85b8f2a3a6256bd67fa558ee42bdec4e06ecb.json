Well the Tweenies love to! In       \n      each of these four fantastic episodes they explore a           \n      different section of the orchestra. First they learn all       \n      about percussion instruments which are Milo's favourite, he    \n      becomes a one-man band and plays them all together! Then       \n      they find out about the strings which Fizz loves, and have     \n      great fun acting out Old King Cole. Next it's the turn of      \n      the brass section, and Bella dreams of leading the others in   \n      a cool brass band. Finally Jake is wild about woodwind and     \n      in this episode the Tweenies take turns playing the recorder   \n      and Judy's flute.                                              \n                                                                    \n     \n                   GROUP NEWS                 \n      \n                                                                    \n         Same ol' same ol'..
