In the complete third season of this acclaimed sitcom, Frasier (Grammer) has encounters with both a woman from his past -- Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) -- and one in his future, in the form of new radio station manager Kate Costas (Mercedes Ruehl). Niles (David Hyde Pierce) is kicked out of the house by wife Maris; Martin (John Mahoney) is exposed as a budding songwriter for Frank Sinatra; and both Daphne (Jane Leeves) and Roz (Peri Gilpin) attract some not-so-secret secret admirers! You?ll enjoy non-stop laughs in all 24 episodes of Frasier?s unrestrained third season presented in this four-disc collection.\n\nEnjoy\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2ed1f6e705e8ac22b72995b30c9e21284e90c13","amp;dn":"Frasier+Season+3+DVD+2+eng-spa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2ed1f6e705e8ac22b72995b30c9e21284e90c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,237,31,110,112,94,138,194,43,114,153,91,48,201,226,18,132,233,12,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
