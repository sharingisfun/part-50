Select the device type (PCI / USB / PCMCIA)\n2. Specify the folder with the driver and click Update Database\nThis database itself is not updated and files are created * devs.upd and * devs.xxx (where ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ- the type that is pci / usb / pcm and xxx ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ number of updates. For example pcidevs.067) During the generation status demonstrates yellow triangle and the end of the green or red circle.\n\nGreen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ new devices are found and added\nred ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ new devices not found (they presentedin database or the driver for another type of device.)\n\nWhen are you going to check on the new device a number of folders / drayveov one type (eg pci) then again click Update Database. Files * devs.upd and * devs.xxx will be supplemented by new recordings. And only after you upgrade one device type click Apply. Then * devs.xxx be renamed the database file * devs.txt, and * devs.upd will be moved to the folder C:  Temp called * devsxxx.upd and displayed, so you can propoposmotret change. He then (* devsxxx.upd) and should be sent to the address listed in the file.\n\nThus you will become one file upd for one type of devices but not a number. Will only remove files buckup-a in the project folder Data  DB type bak_ * devs.xxx This operation until manually\n\nNext, please: Everyone who will update the database devices ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ submit files to *. upd (are the most recent version of the program in the folder C:  Temp) to the address indication in the files.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo stay update with more downloads use RSS:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/OpenCd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/OpenCd&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dea831d07fdfdf56cbb5d2ddcc27b5b8026ed32","amp;dn":"Universal+Drivers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dea831d07fdfdf56cbb5d2ddcc27b5b8026ed32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,234,131,29,7,253,253,245,108,187,93,45,220,194,123,91,128,38,237,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
