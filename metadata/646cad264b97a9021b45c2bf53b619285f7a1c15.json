AnVir Task Manager manages startup \nprograms and active processes, removes spyware and offers a great variety of \nWindows enhancements. No need to install dozen of system utilities. You need \nonly one program instead: AnVir Task Manager.\n\n* Monitor processes, services, startup programs. Replace Task Manager\n* Get rid of spyware and viruses that were missed by your antivirus\n* Enhance and tune up XP or Vista\n* Speed up your PC and Windows startup\n\n \n\n- Highly detailed replacement for Windows Task Manager\nThis highly detailed Task Manager replacement analyzes everything that's \ncurrently active on your system and displays it on a tabbed interface: \nprograms that are scheduled to run upon Windows start, processes and services. \nIt shows full information about each process including command line, DLLs that \nthe program uses, inbound and outbound traffic, disk load, tray icon, \nperformance graph, internet connections.\n\nAnVir Task Manager monitors the system's workload, dropping icons in the \nsystem tray that indicate CPU usage (including a breakdown by application), \nhard drive temperature, free space, disks activity (again with per-application \ninfo), laptop battery, memory, and network inbound and outbound traffic. So the \nuser always exactly knows what loads his PC.\n\n\n- Get rid of malicious software\nRight out of the box, AnVir Task Manager provides security risk rating for each \nactive process, service and startup program. The security risk rating indicates \nthe likelihood of a program being potential spyware, malware or a Trojan. \nThe rating is based on behavior, code analysis, and integrated database with \ninformation about 70 000+ startup programs, Internet Explorer toolbars and \nservices.\n\nWhen any program tries to add itself to startup, AnVir Task Manager shows \nnotification and allows to cancel new startup program if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s useless or harmful. \n\nRight click on any suspicious process or file and check it on virustotal.com \nwith 30 antiviruses.\n\n\n- Enhance Windows, modify hundreds of Windows settings\nAnVir Task Manager makes XP or Vista much handier. The program makes it possible \nto minimize selected application windows to system tray to save the taskbar space \nfrom clutter. You can make windows semi-transparent, or pin them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“always on topÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢- \njust right click on a title of any running application.

Tweaker also includes many settings that cannot be accessed in Windows \nat all without editing the registry directly.\n\n\n- Speed up your PC\nAnVir Task Manager allows you to dramatically speed up your PC or Windows boot \ntime.\n\nStartup tab shows all programs that run on Windows start.

Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at april 29 2009 - 09.15 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:646cad264b97a9021b45c2bf53b619285f7a1c15","amp;dn":"AnVir+Task+Manager+Pro+v5.4.1.0+%2B+Crack+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"646cad264b97a9021b45c2bf53b619285f7a1c15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,108,173,38,75,151,169,2,27,69,194,191,83,182,25,40,95,122,28,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
