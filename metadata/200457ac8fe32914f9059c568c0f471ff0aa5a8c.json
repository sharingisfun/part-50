I tried downloading and converting the flash files from the project website, but that didn't want to work. In the end I just tried various screen capture programs until I got a reasonable copy. This was created with CamStudio 2.0 on Windows 2000.\nhttp://camstudio.org/\n\nDue to the sketchy nature of the recording, this isn't exactly a high fidelity recording. There's a boarder of the screen space around the video as it plays and I'm not certain of the quality of the recording. It plays fine on the video software that comes with CamStudio, but there are green lines all over the place when I play it on VLC. As such, this is more a proof of concept than anything. \n\n(As for seeding, I'll do my best, but this computer is in my bedroom, so it turns off when I have to sleep. I'll get cracking on finding other computers to use.)\t\n\nOthers in this series:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4790788/Rip__a_Remix_Manifesto._Chapter_1\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4790788/Rip__a_Remix_Manifesto._Chapter_2\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4790788/Rip__a_Remix_Manifesto._Chapter_3\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4790788/Rip__a_Remix_Manifesto._Chapter_4\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4790788/Rip__a_Remix_Manifesto._Chapter_5\n(any future uploads will be the same name, with just the last number changed)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:200457ac8fe32914f9059c568c0f471ff0aa5a8c","amp;dn":"Rip%3A+a+Remix+Manifesto.+Chapter+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"200457ac8fe32914f9059c568c0f471ff0aa5a8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,4,87,172,143,227,41,20,249,5,156,86,140,15,71,31,240,170,90,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
