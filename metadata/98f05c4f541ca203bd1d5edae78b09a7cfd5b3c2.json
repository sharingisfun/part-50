Disenchanted is a stunning new webcomic from writer Simon Spurrier that will be collected twice per year, following the model of Freakangels. This is the perfect chance to get in on the ground floor and be prepared to be swept into an immersive World of forgotten secrets anchored by a spectacular web site at www.disenchantedcomic.com!\n\nNobody gives a crap about the little people any more.\n\nOnce they were the mainstay of folklore: goblins, leprechauns, pixies and fey. But now? Dispossessed, forgotten, doubting even their own traditions, theyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve trickled into Vermintown: a vast and vile city of a million inch-tall malcontents. Sprawling through an abandoned subway station deep beneath London, here myth has given way to sleaze, drugs, gangland violence and interracial hatred. Vermintown is where magic went to die.\n\nWritten by Simon Spurrier (X-Men Legacy, Crossed: Wish You Were Here), with art by German Erramouspe (Night of the Living Dead), Disenchanted is an urban thriller slipping a rusty blade between the shoulders of the familiar fairytale. What do you do when nobody believes in you?\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nPrevious Episodes:\n------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9222413&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9222413&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9190712&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9190712&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9144025&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9144025&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9112576&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9112576&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRipped from http://www.disenchantedcomic.com\nDisenchanted is a serialized comic by Simon Spurrier and German Erramouspe from Avatar Press","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98f05c4f541ca203bd1d5edae78b09a7cfd5b3c2","amp;dn":"Disenchanted+-+Episode+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98f05c4f541ca203bd1d5edae78b09a7cfd5b3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,240,92,79,84,28,162,3,189,29,94,218,231,139,9,167,207,213,179,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
