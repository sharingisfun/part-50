Friday Night Dinner is a truly\n                original series about the Goodmans, a family who have\n                made an art form of their eccentricities. In this\n                episode it's Adam's birthday. As he arrives home, a\n                silver Mercedes almost runs him over. Inside, is\n                Sheila Bloom - or 'Bitchface' as Adam and his family\n                call her. 'Bitchface' is famously obsessed with her\n                Mercedes, and after some catty remarks about Adam's\n                'Yugo', she speeds off. Dad reveals that he used to\n                have a thing with Bitchface years ago. The boys\n                can't believe it. Mum's not happy. Later, the family\n                abandon dinner and go for a Chinese, but Bitchface\n                is there. An awkward chat ensues, and finally Dad\n                reveals exactly what he got up to with her.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e89005de5360b87c40aeed7016307b0cad46c6f","amp;dn":"Friday.Night.Dinner.S01E05.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e89005de5360b87c40aeed7016307b0cad46c6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,137,0,93,229,54,11,135,196,10,238,215,1,99,7,176,202,212,108,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
