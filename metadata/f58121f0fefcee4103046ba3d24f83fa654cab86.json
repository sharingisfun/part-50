Here [St PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] Popes with black faces and golden crowns are wallowing twice life-size in the titanic folds of marble tablecloths, their ormolu fringes festooning upon the arms of graceful skeletons to disclose some Alice-in-Wonderland door or the grim hinges of some sepulchral grill . . .\n\n Best known as the author of The Road to Oxiana, published in 1937, Robert Byron had developed his considerable writing skills on this travel book which has not been in print since 1926. It describes a journey Byron made with three friends, driving across Europe between two world wars, and mixes political and historical analysis with architectural insights, classical scholarship, and the day-to-day adventures of three young and not very experienced travelers. For fans of Robert ByronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work this will be a discovery; for others it will be an introduction. Includes nine original sketches made by the author during his travels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58121f0fefcee4103046ba3d24f83fa654cab86","amp;dn":"Europe+in+The+Looking+Glass+-+Robert+Byron.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58121f0fefcee4103046ba3d24f83fa654cab86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,129,33,240,254,252,238,65,3,4,107,163,210,79,131,250,101,76,171,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
