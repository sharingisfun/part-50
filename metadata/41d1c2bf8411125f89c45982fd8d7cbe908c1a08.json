Sonic crusaders Tentacles! score three for three with one of the most compellingly unique listens this fall.\n\nTentacles! is Andrew Ford (Adhesion) of Rochester and Scott Feeney (Scrap Heap) from DC. With an internet collaboration already released in 2006, the duo got together last summer in Rochester for intense improv sessions. And Then... Tentacles! is the distilled result.\n\nYou are not listening to raw jam sessions, but every part on every one of these wordless songs was completely improvised.\n\nWatch out. Tentacles! are unafraid to break the rules of electronic music, and you never know where they&amp;#039;ll strike next.\n\n1. The Warning Shot (2:49)\n2. Cyclone (2:51)\n3. Hollow Dawn (2:42)\n4. Town Square (3:20)\n5. Triumph of Tentacles (2:12)\n6. Drizzle (2:32)\n\nPresented in lossless FLAC with 300 dpi front and back cover art.\n\nThis music is in the public domain and is ocean15, released September 22, 2008 on the Oceanbase netlabel.
