Several crowd agents parameters will be edited to improve the overall quality of the crowd itself and agents will be forced to perform behaviors upon triggering specific events. These tasks are not easy to complete, as most of the tricks (for tricks they are!) required to perform them are not fully documented, particularly for agents behaviors.\n\nIn this tutorial we will delve into the intricate procedures of crowd management. By the end of these lessons you will be fully capable of creating customized crowd agents and controlling them using Kismet in UDK's visual scripting environment.
