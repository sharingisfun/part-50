Also in the mix is a White Label &quot;Uninvited&quot; Remix that I heard many years ago at the best rave I ever went to in Seattle.  Dave Seamen Played it at this party Called &quot;Mixer&quot; and I remember the place just went fuck&amp;#039;n nuts.  I&amp;#039;ll never forget it.  For anyone who cares, the lineup also included Terry Mullen, Dig Dug, Sandra Collins, Donald Glaude, and had an all Female Jungle Room with Eva, Reid Speed, MIA and others.  Still hands down the most off the hook positive parties I&amp;#039;ve ever been to.  \nAnyway, I also throw in a Dj Shadow cut from his &quot;In tune and On time&quot; album and one of my favorite Chemical Brothers songs to end it.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s just a chill mix with good tunes in my opinion...enjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c55d5029ef80a54d30c8e7ed2b65997cad893e7b","amp;dn":"Dj+Rogue+-+August+08+08+%5C%22Just+Messin+Around%5C%22+Dj+Mix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c55d5029ef80a54d30c8e7ed2b65997cad893e7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,93,80,41,239,128,165,77,48,200,231,237,43,101,153,124,173,137,62,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
