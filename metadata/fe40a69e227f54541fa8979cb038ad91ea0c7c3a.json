They decorate their cells and have an established pecking order. The strong inhabit messy individual suites, and the weak are jammed together, as many as sixteen sharing a 100-square-foot (9.3 m2) cell.\n\nSeveral narratives develop in the film: the attempted murder of Peixeira (Milhem Cortaz), the solitary confinement of Chico (Milton GonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§alves), and the romance between Lady Di (Rodrigo Santoro) and No Way (Gero Camilo).\n\nThe doctor establishes a routine and comes to see the prisoners as survivors.\n\nThe picture ends with a violent prison riot that historically took place on October 2, 1992. The repression of the riot became known as the Carandiru Massacre.\n\nCast........:\nLuiz Carlos Vasconcelos as Physician \nMilton GonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§alves as Chico \nIvan de Almeida as Ebony \nAilton GraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a as Majestade \nMaria Luisa MendonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a as Dalva \nAida Leiner as Rosirene \nRodrigo Santoro as Lady Di \nRita Cadillac (Brazilian dancer) as Herself \nGero Camilo as No Way \nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zaro Ramos as Ezequiel \nCaio Blat as Deusdete \nWagner Moura as Zico \nMilhem Cortaz as Peixeira \nJÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºlia Ianina as Francineide \nSabrina Greve as Catarina \nFloriano Peixoto as AntÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´nio Carlos \nNelson Machado as Carioca \n[edit] Production\nDirector Hector Babenco shot the film on location in the actual penitentiary, and in neo-realist fashion he used a huge cast of novice actors - some of whom are former inmates.[2]\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293007/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293007/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe40a69e227f54541fa8979cb038ad91ea0c7c3a","amp;dn":"Carandiru+%28%5B5.1%5D-%5Bmultisubs%5D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe40a69e227f54541fa8979cb038ad91ea0c7c3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,64,166,158,34,127,84,84,31,168,151,156,176,56,173,145,234,12,124,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
