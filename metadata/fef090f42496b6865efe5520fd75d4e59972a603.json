Just google it!\n------------------------------------------------------------\nDOWNGRADING WITH 3.3 OR 3.4 to 2.0 upwards in U-E-J regions.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote that the best firmware for Homebrew is 3.2 so let's do it!\n\nAfter the HBC is installed on your Wii, you can now start the downgrade.\n\nStep 1-- Make sure you have put all files on the SD card. 512Kb - 1Gb - 2Gb will do. NOT a 4Gb! \nPut all apps in 1 folder - all wads in another\n\nStep 2-- Extract the wii downgrade.rar and drag the &quot;apps&quot; and &quot;wad&quot; folder on the SD card.\n\nStep 3-- Using the Homebrew Channel, open WAD Manager 1.3\n\nStep 4-- Press A on the Wii Mote once. The Wii should detect a SD Card. \nPress A again to see a list of WADs on the SD Card. \nUse the D-Pad to select IOS16-64-v257-prod.wad. Press the + to install the WAD. \nOnce it has installed the WAD, press the Home button to restart you Wii.\n\nStep 5-- Using the Homebrew Channel, open Custom WM. \nNow using the same method as in Step 4, install the cios_fix.wad. \nOnce it has installed the WAD, press the Home button to restart you Wii.\n\nNote: If that fails to install, just use 'Wad Manager 1.3'\n\nStep 6-- Using the Homebrew Channel, open IOS Downgrader. \nJust follow the instructions and wait until it finishes installing the necessary IOSs. \n\nNOTE: You're Wii does require connection to the Internet otherwise it won't work. Same for the next step. \nIf you do have a Internet connection and you get errors while it's installing the IOSs, just restart the Wii and try again.\n\nStep 7-- Using the Homebrew Channel, open Install Shop IOS51. \nSay Yes to installing the IOS51 and Yes to patching a fix but No to the \nWii Shop Channel (it shouldnt matter if you install but it wont make any difference). I installed it &amp; it works fine.\n\nStep 8-- Using the Homebrew Channel, open WAD Manager 3.\n\nStep 9-- Now you should be able to install WADs. Try installing the WAD MANAGER V3.wad \n\nStep 10-- Downgrade to 3.2 or whatever firmware you want using cISO Downgrader 1.2. \n\nMake sure you choose the right region or you will semi-brick your Wii. \n(U = USA, E = Europe, J = Japan)\nUse this file with the HBC to downgrade. Make sure you put it in a folder in the 'apps' folder.\nYou can also use AnyRegion Changer to downgrade. (though not tried it)\n\nYour Wii is now downgraded!\n\nOnce ALL this is done you will be able to Up/Down Grade in the future without using Step 7\n\nSimply :\nInstall HBC \nUp/Down Grade\nInstall the IOS files &amp; Loaders\n\nDo not use if you are not sure what you are doing.\nYou use at your own risk.\nNo responsibility will be taken for bricked Wii's - very unlikely this is though\n\nDownload all your games off ESPALWII aka ESPALPSP - try going to his site for many more.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/ESPALPSP/7/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/ESPALPSP/7/1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOr try \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wiiiso.com/download/torrents-pal.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wiiiso.com/download/torrents-pal.php&lt;/a&gt;     For PAL games\n\n\nDon't use patcher on the games - it is not necessary\n\nThanks to all that Seed.\n\n**inAcrysis**\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef090f42496b6865efe5520fd75d4e59972a603","amp;dn":"Wii+3.4+menu+downgrader+%26+twilight+hack+%2A%2AinAcrysis%2A%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef090f42496b6865efe5520fd75d4e59972a603","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,240,144,244,36,150,182,134,94,254,85,32,253,117,212,229,153,114,166,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
