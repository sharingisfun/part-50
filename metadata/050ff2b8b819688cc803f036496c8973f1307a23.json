After downloading the streaming windows media file .wsx, I realized the audio was out of sync with the video by 1.35 seconds and there was 45 minutes of black screen at the end. I used asfbin to advance the audio by 1.35 seconds, cut 45 minutes of black screen from the end and convert it to an indexed .wmv file without re-encoding. Afterward I watched it from the beginning and couldn't tell there was anything wrong, except there's an 8 second camera error starting at 00:16:28 and the video is only 24 frames per second. The first hour and a half is extremely boring, but afterward it gets very good.\n\nCheerz  :-)\n\nThanks to the original uploader CHD2879","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:050ff2b8b819688cc803f036496c8973f1307a23","amp;dn":"The+Training+of+O------+2009-10-31+Halloween+Bash+%287365%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"050ff2b8b819688cc803f036496c8973f1307a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,15,242,184,184,25,104,140,200,3,240,54,73,108,137,115,241,48,122,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
