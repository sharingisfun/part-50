His life \n\nbegins to change, however, when he finds out he's on academic probation, and when he \n\nstumbles into love with Miss Cross, a pretty teacher of the elementary school at \n\nRushmore. Added to the mix is his friendship with Herman Blume, wealthy industrialist \n\nand father to boys who attend the school, and who also finds himself attracted to \n\nMiss Cross. Max's fate becomes inextricably tied to this odd love triangle, and how \n\nhe sets about resolving it is the story in the film","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fec012e44b30fdf98b5ace8e48775b59bb3411e4","amp;dn":"Rushmore.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fec012e44b30fdf98b5ace8e48775b59bb3411e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,192,18,228,75,48,253,249,139,90,206,142,72,119,91,89,187,52,17,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
