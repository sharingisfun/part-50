Any subsequent version will run it. It has sound drivers installed. The included games are APBA Broadcast Blast Baseball For Windows, with the voice of the legendary Ernie Harwell; and Fron Page Sports Baseball 98. Neither of these games will run on any version of Windows higher than 98/Me.\n\nAlso included are the ISO image of APBA (needed to play) and season disks. You will need to set this VM up to point to that ISO to play.\n\nAnd please, fer goshsakes, DO NOT let this connect to the internet, unless you want more infections than a transvestite hooker on Bourbon St!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b3dbde694e3f170d3ef529474e843cd8b68b31c","amp;dn":"W98VMWare-VM-withAPBAandFPSBB.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b3dbde694e3f170d3ef529474e843cd8b68b31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,61,189,230,148,227,241,112,211,239,82,148,116,232,67,205,139,104,179,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
