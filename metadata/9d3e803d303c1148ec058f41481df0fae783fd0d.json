Talk about what Black Metal is to them, and their thoughts on where it is headed. \n\nMostly spoken in Norwegian with English Subtitles, there is one guy that actually speaks English. \n\nSorry for large file size, I am not good at encoding and decoding so I could get a reasonable looking file from what I had.
