Owens on September 13, 1967 in Akron, Ohio. The young Ohio salesman and tribute band frontman made headlines in 1996 when from a fan he became the frontman for the British metal act Judas Priest, filling the shoes of Rob Halford (and, by doing so, inspired the movie Rock Star, which was later discredited by the band). Despite numerous rumours that Rob Halford would reunite with Judas Priest, Owens recorded two studio albums with his childhood heroes, Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003. That same year the frontman for Iced Earth quit the band and Owens became the new lead singer for them after leaving Judas Priest. Iced EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first album with Owens, The Glorious Burden, came out in early 2004.\n\ntracks:\n01. 01 - Starting Over\n02. 02 - Believe\n03. 03 - The Cover Up\n04. 04 - Pick Yourself Up\n05. 05 - It Is Me\n06. 06 - No Good Goodbyes\n07. 07 - To Live Again\n08. 08 - The World Is Blind\n09. 09 - The Light\n10. 10 - Play My Game\n11. 11 - Death Race\n12. 12 - The Shadows Are Alive\n\n\nEncoding: vbr\n\n\nEncoding: vbr\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:384dafe5d4da10beff8c54a6d1856590e1a7d1e0","amp;dn":"Riper+Owens+-+Play+My+Game+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"384dafe5d4da10beff8c54a6d1856590e1a7d1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,77,175,229,212,218,16,190,255,140,84,166,209,133,101,144,225,167,209,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
