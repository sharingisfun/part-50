It is the first official single from her third studio album, Fantasy Ride. The song features rapper Young Jeezy, was produced by Polow da Don, and was co-written by Ciara and Elvis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlacElvisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Williams, who both produced and co-wrote Ciara's single, &quot;Promise&quot;, from her sophomore album, Ciara: The Evolution.\n\nCiara shot the music video for the single in Atlanta in January 2009. Young Jeezy, the song's featured act, made an appearance in the video. A few pictures of the video shoot was released on the web on the following Monday. Rapper Dolla, production team Jasper Cameron and Big Reese, who are also longtime friends of Ciara's, choreographer Jamaica Craft, and R&amp;B singer Monica are cameos in the music video. The project, which was directed by Chris Robinson, had its release date set for January 31, as confirmed by Yahoo! Music. The video was officially released on January 30, 2008 BET's Access Granted. \n\nThe video begins with Ciara and a group of her friends discussing the characteristics of unrequited love, which leads to a scene with Ciara dancing in her penthouse apartment. This scene is mixed with footage of a montage of close-ups with Ciara reciting the song (these clips are shown throughout the whole video). We are then introduced to a party scene, where Ciara and her boyfriend, portrayed by actor Kevin Phillips, are seen dancing with each other. While dancing, her boyfriend glances at another girl in the party - Ciara catches this and walks off, where her boyfriend then catches her and grabs her arm. The video then cuts to a dance sequence, with Ciara and her back-up dancers, in the middle of the crowd in the party. All the while, Ciara and her boyfriend are still arguing. Young Jeezy's scene in front of a golden backdrop is then shown, with Ciara standing beside him. Meanwhile, another guy (portrayed by Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks) comes up to Ciara, introduces himself, and asks her to dance. Realizing that she needs to let go of this frustrating relationship with her boyfriend and move on, she accepts. The video closes out with Ciara reciting the last line of the song, &quot;If that boy don't love you by now...&quot;\n\nOn February 13, 2009, the music video peaked at #2 on 106 &amp; Park Live Top 10 Countdown.\n\nSince the music video's iTunes release, it has peaked at #1 on the Top R&amp;B/Soul Music Videos chart.\nThe video has also peaked at #2 on the iTunes Top 100 Music Videos chart.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:734b28e3a4a9ff1dda8b65fc9eb78396c220abd5","amp;dn":"Ciara+feat.+Young+Jeezy+-+Never+Ever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"734b28e3a4a9ff1dda8b65fc9eb78396c220abd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,75,40,227,164,169,255,29,218,139,101,252,158,183,131,150,194,32,171,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
