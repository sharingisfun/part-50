Sound Like Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Fall Out Boy, New Found Glory, The Starting Line.\n\n\nMusic Review:\n\nLong Island is known for its hardcore and punk scenes and Brookside just adds to that hallowed status. Consecrated in rich harmonies and pop-punk melodies, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTonight, Long IslandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ paves the way towards a catchy anthem or three. They released a demo a while back by themselves and were able to sell over 3,000 copies with grassroots DIY efforts and self-promotion. I love how this band crafts nifty bridges that tie their verses and choruses together so well, crafting a song that is highly addictive and infectious. Purely put, this is a punk band that you must latch onto immediatelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½trust me within one listen, it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be too hard.\n\n- J-Sin \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6bb461ce7fc5b906de232a06e57dc636741b439","amp;dn":"Brookside+-+Tonight%2C+Long+Island","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6bb461ce7fc5b906de232a06e57dc636741b439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,187,70,28,231,252,91,144,109,226,50,160,110,87,220,99,103,65,180,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
