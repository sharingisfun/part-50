To mark this occasion, OehmsClassics brought together all the CDs he's recorded for the label into a Deluxe Edition. Lovingly edited, with a high-quality booklet and many pictures, some of which are previously unknown, this collection is intended as homage to a conductor who, far removed from any star hype, can look back modestly at 90 years of a more than fulfilled musician's life.\n\nThis torrent contains 11 of the 28 CDs in this Box Set. If you recognize the tremendous value of these recordings, please buy the set and support one of the most inspired musicians of the last century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21d53224005530992164c41852f51ef65b102bce","amp;dn":"Skrowaczewski+90+Anniversary+%28partial%29+Bruckner%2C+Beethoven%2C+Brah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21d53224005530992164c41852f51ef65b102bce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,213,50,36,0,85,48,153,33,100,196,24,82,245,30,246,91,16,43,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
