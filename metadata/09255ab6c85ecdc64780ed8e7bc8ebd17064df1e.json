Indeed, she's one female pop star who's truly earned her army boots. Though her once meteoric musical career has suffered due to her outspokenness, the powerful voice and presence found on her second album is beyond reproach. Best known as the source of O'Connor's breakthrough cover of Prince's &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U,&quot; this is a moving, intensely passionate work full of dark beauty and longing, constructed with a fierce independence and a taste for the unique. This undeniably pop album (albeit with modern-rock and folk elements) has more than held up through the years. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Front-8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Front-8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: trackList :.\n\n01 Feel So Different\n02 I Am Stretched On Your Grave\n03 Three Babies\n04 The Emporer's New Clothes\n05 Black Boys On Mopeds\n06 Nothing Compares 2 U\n07 Jump In The River\n08 You Cause As Much Sorrow\n09 The Last Day Of Our Acquaintance\n10 I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09255ab6c85ecdc64780ed8e7bc8ebd17064df1e","amp;dn":"Sinead+OConnor+-+I+Do+Not+Want+What+I+Havent+Got+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09255ab6c85ecdc64780ed8e7bc8ebd17064df1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,37,90,182,200,94,205,198,71,128,237,142,123,200,235,209,112,100,223,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
