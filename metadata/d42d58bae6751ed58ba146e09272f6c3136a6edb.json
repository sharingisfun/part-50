Previously On Survivor, Next Time on Survivor, Final Words clips included.\n\nVideo_TS folder ready to burn.\n\n***DVD Label Included***\n\nComplete with improved DVD menus. No sub-titles. ***WIDESCREEN VERSION***\n\nVery Good Quality!\n\nNOTE: In case you catch it, it was not a boo-boo on my part. The Survivor/NBC editors didn't include one single clip from day 17, weird! Please remember to be courteous and seed back to at least 1.5 (2.0 or more preferably) Thanks in advance. That way I shouldn't have to re-seed to keep the torrent alive. Your input is always welcome!\n\nAs Always, Enjoy,\n~dropcutter~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42d58bae6751ed58ba146e09272f6c3136a6edb","amp;dn":"Survivor+Tocantins+E07%5Bdropcutter%5DDVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42d58bae6751ed58ba146e09272f6c3136a6edb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,45,88,186,230,117,30,213,139,161,70,224,146,114,246,195,19,106,110,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
