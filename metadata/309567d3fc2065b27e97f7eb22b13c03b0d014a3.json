It manages to pack so many astounding facts about 9/11 and present them in a gripping manner.\n\nI especially like the way viewers get to live through the hurdles faced by other concerned journalists and citizens investigating 9/11. For example, the hit-piece by the &quot;Bare Facts&quot; O'Reilly-esk news sequence with the sullying 'expert' is very fitting.\n\nProducing a movie on such a controversial and under-reported topic must've been tough. But it was well worth it and should be an inspiration to all of us.\n\n\nBuy the DVD if you can !\nhttp://reflectingpoolfilm.com/reflectingpoolbuydvd.htm\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309567d3fc2065b27e97f7eb22b13c03b0d014a3","amp;dn":"The+Reflecting+Pool+-+DVDRip+-+2008+-+GPA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309567d3fc2065b27e97f7eb22b13c03b0d014a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,149,103,211,252,32,101,178,126,151,247,235,34,177,60,3,176,208,20,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
