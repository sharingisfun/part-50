Cocaine, once a drug exclusively for the rich and famous, is now the most popular class A drug in Britain, with more than 1.2 million people taking it in the UK in 2009. The film follows three users on nights out on coke and uses cutting-edge computer graphics to journey inside their bodies and brains to find out how the drug creates its highs and its lows. For some cocaine is the ideal addition to a night out, but for others taking it became a life-changing event, including the young man that needed a pacemaker fitted at just 17 after cocaine gave him a heart attack and a patient undergoing surgery to repair a nose torn apart by too many lines of coke. Britain's leading experts help explain the truth behind cocaine's controversial reputation - the perfect pick-me-up or a killer class A?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a59e616a2fea8fc891906bc009a147c51083e2bf","amp;dn":"How.Drugs.Work.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264-FTP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a59e616a2fea8fc891906bc009a147c51083e2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,158,97,106,47,234,143,200,145,144,107,192,9,161,71,197,16,131,226,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
