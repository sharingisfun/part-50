Their first single &quot;The Mistake&quot; was launched on Memorial Day 2007 on their newly formed MySpace page. American Taxi has since released an EP entitled Runaway Songs, containing &quot;The Mistake&quot; and five other tracks.\nIn April 2009 American Taxi was signed to Virgin Records]. Since the band's name so closely resembled bluegrass group Great American Taxi, they are now being referred to as AM Taxi until further notice.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOur goal is to take that 45 or 60 minutes and let people get away for a little bit,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Adam. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnd maybe even convert some of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“em to AM Taxi fans. And, if they dig what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing, maybe theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll check out some of the stuff that influenced us.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTracklist:\t\t\t\t\t\n1.
