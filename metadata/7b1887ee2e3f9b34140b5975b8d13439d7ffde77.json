If one of you wonderful Stern fans would like to help me out with the show I would greatly appreciate it.  I am looking for someone to do the following:\n\n               * Remove commercials\n               * Separate Show &amp; Wrap Up\n               * Create 64kbps version\n\nI simply do not have the time to do any of this.  I work 60 hours a week and record the show with a live Sirius stream through a sound board.  There is lots of work involved in maintaining the server that encodes the show and uploading the content every day.  The person and/or people that helps will basically benefit by getting the show before it is posted here.  So you could be hearing today's show within minutes after it ends live.  \n\nIf you would be so kind to help and give back for my contribution then please leave a comment below with your e-mail address or a way to contact you and I will respond with more details.  Thanks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b1887ee2e3f9b34140b5975b8d13439d7ffde77","amp;dn":"Howard_Stern_128k_06-11-2009%2Bwrapup_%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b1887ee2e3f9b34140b5975b8d13439d7ffde77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,24,135,238,46,63,155,52,20,11,89,117,184,209,52,57,215,255,222,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
