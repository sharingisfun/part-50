I used another Piratebay user's IPOD version to create this PSP version. All credits to him/her. I tested it on my PSP 3000 and it works fine. Please test it on other devices and leave a comment for other users.\n\nI will try to seed this as long as I can.\n\nThe movies included are:\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture\nStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\nStar Trek III: The Search for Spock\nStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home\nStar Trek V: The Final Frontier\nStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\nStar Trek Generations\nStar Trek: First Contact\nStar Trek: Insurrection\nStar Trek Nemesis\nStar Trek\n\nMore info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(film_series)\n\n\nThese movies represent some of the most memorable science fiction material ever produced. Please support the original creators of these productions by purchasing an official version, when you can.\n\n\nEnough talk.
