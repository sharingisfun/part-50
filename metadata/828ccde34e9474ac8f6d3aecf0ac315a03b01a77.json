Obviously to little effect- he plays as good as ever! Listen to &quot;Yor pretty face&quot; and you'll see what I mean.. In my opinion-on that tour, Iggy had a kick ass backing band.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828ccde34e9474ac8f6d3aecf0ac315a03b01a77","amp;dn":"Iggy+Pop+-+Rock+Hard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828ccde34e9474ac8f6d3aecf0ac315a03b01a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,140,205,227,78,148,116,172,143,109,58,236,240,172,49,90,3,176,26,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
