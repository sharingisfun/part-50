Howard ends up in Cleveland, where he rescues singer Beverly Switzer from a group of thugs. Beverly and Phil are friends, and when the government is told about Howard, she helps Phil and Dr. Jenning hide Howard from the authorities until they can get him back home -- but then an evil being arrives through the laser beam and takes possession of Dr. Jenning's body, putting Howard, Beverly, and Phil in a fight for their lives.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091225/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091225/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThanks For Downloading!\n\nPlease Seed!\n\n~Wolftatt2~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29b7b636c7149bca7bbb9a2d8ca44e8e546639ef","amp;dn":"Howared+The+Duck+%7B1986%7D+DVDRip.Xvid%7EWolftatt2%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29b7b636c7149bca7bbb9a2d8ca44e8e546639ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,183,182,54,199,20,155,202,123,187,154,45,140,164,78,142,84,102,57,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
