For 26 weeks it ran in grainy black &amp; white and was a sensation.  For half a year, pubs thinned out for Wednesday evening.  With the rounded tones of Sir Michael Redgrave and Sir Ralph Richardson as the narrators, and previously unseen archival footage, The Great War was a television phenomenon.\n\nThen overnight it disappeared. [?] For decades, military historians prodded the corporation and its co-producer, the Imperial War Museum, to release the tapes.  [?] Until now, nearly 40 years on (April 2009), [?] a series of video tapes in a joint venture between the BBC and Britain's leading military video company, DD Video.\n\nAnd what a series.  Despite the distortions of time and memory, the programmes live up to their reputation.  Two thing[s] stick out - just how differently the Great War was treated in 1964 and, much more significantly, just how the soldiers of 1914-18 talked about their experiences.&quot;\n\nVideo codec:  MS MPEG-4 v3 (DIV3) AVI\nResolution:  512x384\nFrame rate:  25\nDecoded format:  Planar 4:2:0 YUV\n\nAudio codec:  Windows Media Audio 2 (WMA2)\nChannels:  Stereo\nSample rate:  44100 Hz\nBitrate:  16 kb/ps\nLanguage: English\n\n\nYour review encourage me...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab7efbf18238eb84cbbe21c7c52a97fbc901556","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Great+War+1964","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab7efbf18238eb84cbbe21c7c52a97fbc901556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,183,239,191,24,35,142,184,76,187,226,28,124,82,169,127,188,144,21,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
