Their first album was the best selling synthpop CD in Scandinavia in recent years (spawning no less than 4 singles) and was also awarded ?Best Album? at the Scandinavian Alternative Music Awards (SAMA) in 2005.\n\nIn 2006 they they released the highly successful album &quot;Uprising&quot; which includes 12 perfect electronic pop tunes that stick like glue!  Going from a duo to a trio has left little imprint on their uplifting electronic hit pop sound, but has pushed the technical aspects of the recordings to new heights. I suspect third member Hans Olsson is the one with the sophisticated know-how necessary to make an album like &quot;Uprising&quot; sound so good.\n\n?Uprising? is comprised of 47 minutes of shimmering and glittering synthpop with many small pearls. Insanely infectious and competent club pop focused on the strong vocals of Christer Lundberg and pure chorus power. The same goes for the energetic opener &quot;Soma Generation&quot;, the lyrically hilarious &quot;60 Is the new 40&quot; and &quot;The Message&quot;, eminating club glee in all its catchy simplicity. There are several hits, for example &quot;Fire&quot; which is reminiscent of Similou and LeSport.&quot;Sad Song&quot; is preppy pop tune which brings up images of Erasure. \n\nTracklisting\n\n01.
