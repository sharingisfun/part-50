But here he's happily, \nblissfully married, and his scenes with wife Myrna Loy are playful and cute. \nThe only glitch is, his secretary is Jean Harlow, and despite Gable's fidelity, \ntongues will inevitably wag. Harlow here has none of the boisterous sass of her \nearlier pairings with Gable--she really is just an efficient and plucky \nsecretary, even if boss and assistant trade charged glances during a business \ntrip to Havana--and so the movie's tone is pretty genteel. The greenhorn James \nStewart, still a couple of years from stardom, plays Harlow's mild but \nsuspicious suitor, and he gets stuck with obligatory dialogue urging Harlow to \ngive up her job and settle down with him. (The movie is interesting in showing \nhow productive and fulfilled Harlow is by work rather than marriage.) MGM \nmainstay Clarence Brown directed, with an approach so dignified that nothing, \nalas, ever gets too giddy. Still, Gable and Loy are so fun together the movie \nsucceeds. For Thin Man fans who can't get enough of Loy and the idea of marriage\n-as-playtime, this is a good fix. --Robert Horton\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5879ed78351f9532b5683664f44a1ad0085e7143","amp;dn":"Wife+Versus+Secretary+%281936%29+%5BDVDrip_XviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5879ed78351f9532b5683664f44a1ad0085e7143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,121,237,120,53,31,149,50,181,104,54,100,244,74,26,208,8,94,113,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
