I must admit, I was skeptical myself. \nAlthough I have yet to find printed lyrics of their works (I doubt \nthat they are included in their albums except for their newest, al-\nthough I could be mistaken), I did manage to find an interview on an \n&quot;unofficial&quot; fan site, in which a doctor tells a strange story in \nwhich he saw the musical half of the duo, Martin Bladh. Throughout \nthe interview, he analyzes the lyrics presented on &quot;Oedipus Dethro-\nned&quot; from a Biblical standpoint. What makes the interview so bizarre \nis that the writer goes one step further, and proclaims Martin Bladh \nto be the resurrected Christ! While the music is obviously obsessed \nwith various Christian principles (mainly regarding the crucifixion), \nit is perhaps safer to say that the music approaches the matter with \na more ambiguous attitude, while outwardly projecting a zealous (al-\nmost fanatical) image. Proof of this can be found on the lyrics \nprinted on the front of the &quot;Four Studies...&quot; EP IRM released in \nearly 2000. The graphic lyrics, although presenting the listener \nwith an immediate horror, are very symbolic in nature, and thus open \nto multiple interpretation.\n\nBut what about this album in particular? It basically consists of \ndeep electric bass lines, muted kick drum rhythms, and various higher \npitched squeals and beeps. Various kinds of static, distortion, and \nfeedback also freely float throughout the songs. This is complimented \nby Erik Jarl's highly distorted and watery shouting (ala Will's John \nMcRae, although in a much less irritating manner). Industrial ele-\nments also appear from time to time. Finally, a small amount of samp-\nles are scattered throughout the songs as well (mainly in the first \nsong).\n\nSo, how does the album stack up? Well, it is best to ignore the pse-\nudo-religious/spiritual overtones and enjoy the album through what \nyou probably sought out in it in the first place: the noise. Also, it \nis always refreshing to find a power electronics outfit that manages \nto be effective and menacing without resorting to cartoonish vio-\nlence, childish misanthropic stances, or highly charged political in-\ncorrectness. There is also a nice diversity to the sounds as well, \nranging from alluring hums (some of which border on dark ambient) and \nthe highly oscillated and distorted (one of the best songs is &quot;Inside \nThe Skull Of A Manniquin&quot;, which strangely reminds me of Throbbing \nGristle's &quot;Hamburger Lady&quot; for some reason, mainly because of the vo-\ncals).\n\nPower electronics is of course an acquired taste, but for those with \na taste of the electronically unusual, &quot;Oedipus Dethroned&quot; is an ex-\ncellent place to start. Cold Meat Industries should still be selling \nthis album, otherwise you might have to search a little bit. If you \ncan listen to their contributions to the &quot;Nihil&quot; compilation on that \nlabel, they are also quite excellent and rank up their with the best \nof their work.\n\nEDIT: Am eventually going to clean up the bloated labels list; have \nnoticed there are a few that can safely be removed (mainly the vari-\nous record label labels I will more than likely not use again). The \nmovies are of IRM during a label festival 2007. While the actual vi-\nsuals do not leave much to write home about, the audio is a bit cle-\naner than usual with these types of recordings.\n\n(Chandler N.)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                         ...:::pitybÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡:::...\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNFO generated on.....: 2010.01.11. 16:09:44","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f83dc0ce7c9fed093a98d82bb0da01155e58d4a4","amp;dn":"IRM-Oedipus_Dethroned-%28CMI.87%29-CD-2000-LOSSLESS-pityba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f83dc0ce7c9fed093a98d82bb0da01155e58d4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,61,192,206,124,159,237,9,58,152,216,43,176,218,1,21,94,88,212,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
