Why not.  It doesn't cost you anything.  Its always funny watching stingy people be stingy over something that has no value.\n\nI would like all of my seeders to reach a 3:1 ratio or a seed time of a week.  Which ever is less time or less upload.\n\nEnjoy.  I have an up speed greater than kernel.org's up speed.  This should be the way it's done.\n\nThanks for downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbeda7a5dfc742eff1daed620b049061c59dbb7","amp;dn":"linux-2.6.32.7+src+stable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbeda7a5dfc742eff1daed620b049061c59dbb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,190,218,122,93,252,116,46,255,29,174,214,32,176,73,6,28,89,219,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
