Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people the 11\\&amp;#039;s. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he\\&amp;#039;d destroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11\\&amp;#039;s who\\&amp;#039;ve stolen a military secret and is caught by a member of the Britannian task force sent after them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for disobeying orders, while the military secret, a young girl, gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is secretly made the pilot of Britannia\\&amp;#039;s brand new prototype Knightmare, Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion to destroy Britannia once and for all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a4321222ae44ad34796bc0e5dd7435527b50b84","amp;dn":"Code+Geass+DPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a4321222ae44ad34796bc0e5dd7435527b50b84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,67,33,34,42,228,74,211,71,150,188,14,93,215,67,85,39,181,11,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
