It was first published as a serial from August 1864 to January 1866. The final chapter was left incomplete when she died suddenly in 1865.\n\nThe story revolves around Molly Gibson, only daughter of a widowed doctor, living in the provincial village of Hollingford in the 1830s. When MollyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father marries again, the innocent young woman acquires a stepsister ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the lively and worldly-wise Cynthia. Affection quickly grows between the two very different girls, but secrets in CynthiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family background begin to create difficulties.\n\n* This is an excellent production from the golden age of BBC radio drama; the nine-hour running time really does full justice to the novel. The charming incidental music was an early work by Oscar-winning film composer Rachel Portman. \n\nCast:\nMrs Gaskell (narrator) .......... Thelma Whiteley\nMolly Gibson ..........
