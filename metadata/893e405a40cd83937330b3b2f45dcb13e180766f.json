This is an absolute must see)\n\nPresented by superstar boffin Professor Hans Rosling, whose eye-opening, mind-expanding and funny online lectures have made him an international internet legend.\nRosling is a man who revels in the glorious nerdiness of statistics, and here he entertainingly explores their history, how they work mathematically and how they can be used in today's computer age to see the world as it really is, not just as we imagine it to be.\nRosling's lectures use huge quantities of public data to reveal the story of the world's past, present and future development. Now he tells the story of the world in 200 countries over 200 years using 120,000 numbers - in just four minutes.\n\n*****\n\nDangerous Knowledge:\nHistory, Science Documentary narrated by David Malone and published by BBC in 2007\nIn this one-off documentary, David Malone looks at four brilliant mathematicians - Georg Cantor, Ludwig Boltzmann, Kurt GÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶del and Alan Turing - whose genius has profoundly affected us, but which tragically drove them insane and eventually led to them all committing suicide.\nThe film also talks to the latest in the line of thinkers who have continued to pursue the question of whether there are things that mathematics and the human mind cannot know. They include Greg Chaitin, mathematician at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center, New York, and Roger Penrose.\nDangerous Knowledge tackles some of the profound questions about the true nature of reality that mathematical thinkers are still trying to answer today.\n\nPart 1: God's Messenger\nThe film begins with Georg Cantor, the great mathematician whose work proved to be the foundation for much of the 20th-century mathematics. He believed he was God's messenger and was eventually driven insane trying to prove his theories of infinity.\nLudwig Boltzmann's struggle to prove the existence of atoms and probability eventually drove him to suicide.\n\nPart 2: The Enigma\nKurt Goetel, the introverted confidant of Einstein, proved that there would always be problems which were outside human logic. His life ended in a sanatorium where he starved himself to death.\n\nPart: 3 Alan Turing\nThe great Bletchley Park code breaker, father of computer science, died trying to prove that some things are fundamentally unprovable.\nLets not forget he was chemically neutered and driven to suicide by his Government, not much less than state sanctioned murder.\n\nYes people the Government of the UK persecuted to death one of the greatest minds in history.\nThe State has no business on your bedroom.\nThe state does not have the right to decide who you can or cannot marry.\nThe state does not have the right to decide on the physical or emotional nature of interactions between consenting adults.\nIm not gay and I dont give a flying fuck who is or for that matter , isnt.\nBefore any of you religousy types throw any kind of scripture into the ring... dont bother - Im an aetheist too.\n\n*****\n\nThe Story of Math:\nThe Story of Maths is a BBC series outlining aspects of the history of mathematics. The series was a co-production between the Open University and the BBC and aired in October 2008 on BBC Four. The material was written and presented by Oxford professor Marcus du Sautoy.\n\nThe series comprised four programmes respectively titled:\n1. The Language of the Universe\n2. The Genius of the East\n3. The Frontiers of Space\n4. To Infinity and Beyond.\n\nDu Sautoy documents the development of mathematics covering subjects such as the invention of zero and the unproven Riemann hypothesis, a 150 year old problem for which the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1,000,000 prize for its solution. He escorts viewers through the subject's history and geography. He examines the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how mathematical ideas underpin the science, technology, and culture that shape our world.\nHe starts his journey in ancient Egypt and finishes it by looking at current mathematics. But in between he travels through Babylon, Greece, India, China, and the medieval Middle East. He also looks at mathematics in Europe and then in America and takes the viewers inside the lives of many of the greatest mathematicians.\n\n*****\n\nBeautiful Equations:\nArtist and writer Matt Collings takes the plunge into an alien world of equations. He asks top scientists to help him understand five of the most famous equations in science, talks to Stephen Hawking about his equation for black holes and comes face to face with a particle of anti-matter.\nAlong the way he discovers why Newton was right about those falling apples and how to make sense of E=mc2. As he gets to grips with these equations he wonders whether the concept of artistic beauty has any relevance to the world of physics.\n\n*****\n\nAlso included are:\n\nFractals - Hunting the Hidden Dimension\nHigh Anxieties - The Mathematics Of Chaos\nHorizon 1996 - Fermat's Last Theorum\nHorizon - Alan and Marcus Go Forth and Multiply\nHorizon - How Long is a Piece of String\nOpen University - Emergence of Greek Mathematics\nPowers Of Ten\nThe Music of the Primes\nThe Secret Life Of Chaos\nTo Infinity and Beyond\nEquinox - Chaos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893e405a40cd83937330b3b2f45dcb13e180766f","amp;dn":"Mathematics%2C+chaos+%26+Stats%5C%27+doccos+collection.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893e405a40cd83937330b3b2f45dcb13e180766f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,62,64,90,64,205,131,147,115,48,179,178,244,93,203,19,225,128,118,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
