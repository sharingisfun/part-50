After his twin dies in an accident, strange things happen to Jerry at a dizzying pace: a fortune shows up in his bank account, weapons are delivered to his flat, and a voice on his cell phone tells him the police are on their way. Jerry follows the voice's instructions, and soon he and a woman he's never met are racing through the city, on to a plane, and eventually to the Pentagon, chased by the FBI. She is Rachel Holloman, a single mom; the voice has threatened her son's death if she doesn't cooperate. The voice seems to know everything. Who is behind it, what is being planned, and why Jerry and Rachel?\n\nSNAPSHOTS:-\n\nIF LIKED THEN GIVE REPLY,UR REPLY MEANS US A LOT.\n                       THANKS:-\n                     PJRV-RELEASE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:686d4fea7981959ece9472421cafbb04342e2a52","amp;dn":"EAGLE+EYE%282008%29IN+HINDI+DVDRIP-PJRV+RELEASE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"686d4fea7981959ece9472421cafbb04342e2a52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,109,79,234,121,129,149,158,206,148,114,66,28,175,187,4,52,46,42,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
