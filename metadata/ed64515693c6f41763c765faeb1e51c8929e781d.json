Dori&amp;#039;s Father \n\n\n\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re a fan of the early days of Rock and Roll, then this is a must see. Rock Rock Rock has one of the best line ups of early rock talent seen in these types of films. Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers do two numbers as do The Moonglows. Also on hand are rare film appearances by The Flamingos and LaVerne Baker. Rock Rock Rock also contains the only film performance by the great rockabilly group, The Johnny Burnette Trio. Singer-songwriter-producer Teddy Randazzo does several songs with The Three Chuckles and is the male lead opposite Tuesday Weld (whose singing voice is over dubbed by a then unknown Connie Francis. The plot however, is unbelievably ridiculous (it centers around a prom dress!) and Tuedsay Weld plays an incredibly DUMB teenager (she thinks 1 percent of a dollar is one dollar). Alan Freed is great though, introducing the acts and you&amp;#039;ll hear one of his top tenor sax specialists, Freddie Mitchell. Fast forward through the &quot;story&quot; and head for the musical numbers if you want, but don&amp;#039;t miss this one if you love early Rock and Roll! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed64515693c6f41763c765faeb1e51c8929e781d","amp;dn":"Rock%2C+Rock%2C+Rock+1956+%28DIVX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed64515693c6f41763c765faeb1e51c8929e781d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,100,81,86,147,198,244,23,99,199,101,250,235,30,81,200,146,158,120,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
