When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy's passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7c521900b259e2346e79f30b5e8251ce1c761e9","amp;dn":"Ratatouille+%282007%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7c521900b259e2346e79f30b5e8251ce1c761e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,197,33,144,11,37,158,35,70,231,159,48,181,232,37,28,225,199,97,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
