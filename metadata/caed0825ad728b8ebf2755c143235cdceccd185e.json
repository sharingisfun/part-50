In 102 AD England, Romans receive a surprise visit from Cleopatra. Nearby, Stonehenge conceals the Pandorica, a prison-box of legend. As it slowly unlocks from the inside, terrible forces gather in the heavens above. The fates are drawing close around the TARDIS. The Pandorica, which contains the most dangerous threat in the Universe, is opening. Only one thing is certain: &quot;The Pandorica will open... silence will fall&quot;.\n\nFormatted to work on iPods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caed0825ad728b8ebf2755c143235cdceccd185e","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+512+-+The+Pandorica+Opens+-+iPod+Compatible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caed0825ad728b8ebf2755c143235cdceccd185e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,237,8,37,173,114,139,142,191,39,85,193,67,35,92,220,236,205,24,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
