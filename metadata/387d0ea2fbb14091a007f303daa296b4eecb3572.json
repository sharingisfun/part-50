The default version of this that comes with Windows 7 hides a lot of power underneath a very unexciting MS blue backdrop .. eww .. not for long.\n\nTime to make W7MC the way it 'should' have been....\n\nIn this collection you will find a comprehensive archive of quality add-ons, hackz and customizations along with a toolbox full of apps to get the most out of your W7MC and Windows 7. There is not any definitive source for W7MC which has everything, although there are some good sources out there when you start digging. It can be hard to find what you want, so I hope this will help those wanting to get into Media Centers but never really knew where to start. Remember there are some great forums and information sources out there if you get stuck with anything.\n\nAlso to give it some extra polish and customisation there is also a collection of media center related artwork made by some very talented artists, from themes to icons to wallpapers at your disposal. These will really enhance the overall feel of your Media Center. I have compressed the Artwork folder to save on download, but have included a screenshot of whats included within.\n\nSome Key improvements that can be achieved:\n===========================================\nCustomize almost every aspect of the look and feel of Media Center.\nAdd support for all Media Types\nEnhanced Browsing and Media Information\nOnline New, TV, Radio\nEnhanced TV Guide\nMedia Editing Tools &amp; Windows 7 Visual Customizations 4 MC\nEnhanced Game &amp; Emulator support\n\nThese are latest versions, tested specifically for Windows 7 Media Center. I have tried to exclude those enhancements that are too buggy or incomplete to ensure you can create a great Media Center experience!\n\nWhere possible I have added some info to help get you started and also the links to the websites (NO DODGY LINKS - All Legit) so you can support the developers, get forum help and latest versions.\n\n** Much of what is in this collection was made by people in the community who love their media centers and is often free or donate only! If you like and you get enjoyment out of it, then please show it - give something back and contribute where you can showing your support to the artists &amp; programmers who put in countless hours creating this stuff **\n\nThank you!!\n\nI won't bother writing out a long list of what is included, you can see that in the torrent - hope you enjoy :)  \n\n\nPeace.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:387d0ea2fbb14091a007f303daa296b4eecb3572","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Media+Center+MOD+Archive+1.0+%7BCollection+of+Addons-Too","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"387d0ea2fbb14091a007f303daa296b4eecb3572","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,125,14,162,251,177,64,145,160,7,243,3,218,162,150,180,238,203,53,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
