Quality is moderate; not great, but good enough to watch without issues (that I noticed anyway). \n\nConversions were made using Handbrake, handbrake.fr.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ca0f342d8db564b47fbe424890c39eaec5a3766","amp;dn":"Sailor+Moon+.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ca0f342d8db564b47fbe424890c39eaec5a3766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,160,243,66,216,219,86,75,71,251,228,36,137,12,57,234,236,90,55,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
