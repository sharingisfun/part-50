Some films from TPB are so badly encoded that it makes me sick. The video/audio bitrate of my encoding is 1235/115 but the quality is pretty decent. \n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523b530dfc9160c8b605a4053b8e19d7aec0ef98","amp;dn":"The+Shawshank+Redemption+%5BH.264%5D%5BAAC%5D%5BMP4%5D%5BEN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523b530dfc9160c8b605a4053b8e19d7aec0ef98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,59,83,13,252,145,96,200,182,5,164,5,59,142,25,215,174,192,239,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
