Her mission is to make contact with a rather nerdy young scientist, who's quite overwhelmed by her attentions, and isn't aware of the connection between her arrival and his work.\n\nNOTE: Enjoyable, funny, comedy classic. Do not be bothered by insane iMDB rating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79c1ef1d946580e3af61092f3ddeb2a2cc13391c","amp;dn":"epmother.is.an.Alien.1988.HDTV.720p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79c1ef1d946580e3af61092f3ddeb2a2cc13391c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,193,239,29,148,101,128,227,175,97,9,47,61,222,178,162,204,19,57,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
