The superstar acclaimed by millions as magical, brilliant, and angelic is our one and only Fairuz.\n\nBorn and raised in Lebanon, Fairuz began her musical career as a teenager. From chorus girl at the Lebanese radio station in the late 1940s, to critical and popular acclaim from the 1950's to today, Fairuz is acknowledged not only for her musical talent and contribution, but also as a cultural and political icon. A symbol of a people, a heritage, a quest for peace, and of humanity.\n\nDuring most of her career, Fairuz reflected two other great artists, Assi and Mansour Rahbani. They wrote the lyrics and composed her tunes. Today, many of her songs reflect the composing talent of Ziad Rahbani who is Fairuz's son. Her songs testify to the Rahbani musical genius, as well as to Fairuz's broad musical background. As Dr. J. Racy says, 'More than just a singer's name, Fairuz is a concept whose connotations are ethnic and nationalistic, as well as musical and poetic.' Referred to as 'The Soul of Lebanon' in the 70's, Fairuz became a pre-eminent figure, a superstar of current music in the Arab world. Together, the Rahbani family is both a school of music and a cultural phenomenon. (fairuzonline.com)\n\n- - -\n\nFairuz - Modern Favorites\n(Virgin 2001)\n\n 1. Al Bosta   \n 2. Ishatktellak  \n 3.
