The project results in the creation of two devices, the Alpha Suit, a \nless advanced prototype jump suit, and the Beta Suit, a more advanced, \nso-called military grade model with features the Alpha Suit lacks such as \ncombat-related timeshifting abilities and an integrated artificial intelligence \nto prevent the creation of temporal paradoxes.\n\nThe director of the project, Dr. Aiden Krone, takes the Alpha Suit and travels \ninto the past. Once there he alters the timeline, placing himself as the ruler \nof the Krone Magistrate that controls a dystopic world.\n\nThe protagonist, a fellow scientist whose name is never spoken (never mentioned \nin the game or manual), then takes the Beta Suit and follows Dr. Krone back to \nthe year 1939 (in an alternate timestream) to a place called Alpha District. He\nthen proceeds to assist the Occupant Rebellion against Dr. Krone.\n\nHe is confronted eventually by Krone in giant war-machine which nearly destroys \nthe Occupant Rebellion, but succeeds in destroying it. As an incapacitated \nKrone emerges from the wreckage, the protagonist walks up to him and kills him. \nHe is thanked by the Occupant commander and returns to the beginning of the \ngame to save his girlfriend who had been killed by the explosion Krone had \ncaused. He shuts down the bomb and walks up to his girlfriend, who begins to \nwake up and reaches out to him but does not not know who he is. As he begins to \nremove his mask the AI in the suit cries out the alert that a paradox is \nimminent, and transports him away.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMinimum System Requirements:\n\t\n\n\t*  Operating System: Windows 2000/XP\n    \t* Processor: 2 GHz processor (2.5 GHz recommended)\n    \t* RAM: 512 MB RAM\n    \t* Video Card: 128 MB video card with full hardware T&amp;L support\n    \t* Processor: Sound Card, Mouse, Keyboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHow to Install:\n\n\n\tSTEP 1:\t\tExtract file with 7z to anywhere you like.\n\t\t\t(note: Game will install to 'OS': Games TimeShift)\n\n\n\tSTEP 2:\t\tDouble click 'setup.exe' in 'Freeman' folder.\n\n\n\tSTEP 3:\t\tFollow on screen instructions!\n\t\t\t*DO NOT INTERRUPT PROCESS ONCE EXTRACTION HAS BEGUN*\n\n\t\n\tSTEP 4:\t\tStart game from Desktop. \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\nNothing is ripped!!!\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tN'Joy!\n\n\n\nFreeman G Ripper\n\n\n\nI highly recommend you go check out the following sites: \n\n\twww.davidicke.com\n\twww.cuttingthroughthematrix.com\n\ttracker.conspiracycentral.net\n\n\ncheck out the forums!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment and leave feedback!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c015293c275df482c791e6d53052d396630d9cbd","amp;dn":"TimeShift+-+PC+Rip+by+Freeman+G+Ripper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c015293c275df482c791e6d53052d396630d9cbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,21,41,60,39,93,244,130,199,145,230,213,48,82,211,150,99,13,156,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
