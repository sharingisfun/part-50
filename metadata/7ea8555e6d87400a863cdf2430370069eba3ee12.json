Family loyalty eventually drove the two young lovers apart; Trace disappeared from their small Texas town while Callie married her father's foreman, bore two children, and became a young widow. It isn't until Trace's father has a heart attack that he returns to Texas and comes looking for Callie, the one woman he's never been able to forget. But although Callie has never stopped loving Trace, she harbors a secret that could destroy any chance of a future with him.\n\nJust when it seems that the two lovers may work out a solution, tragedy strikes the Creeds. Once again their family problems may be a direct result of the bitter feud with the Blackthornes that has so badly damaged the family in the past. And this time, the stunning truth may drive Trace and Callie apart forever.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea8555e6d87400a863cdf2430370069eba3ee12","amp;dn":"Joan+Johnston+-+The+Texan+-+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea8555e6d87400a863cdf2430370069eba3ee12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,168,85,94,109,135,64,10,134,60,223,36,48,55,0,105,235,163,238,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
