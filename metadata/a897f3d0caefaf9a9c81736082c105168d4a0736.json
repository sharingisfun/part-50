This release includes all the subs that\nis on the DVD. Also decided to use a different resolution to get less\nAR error.\n\nFor the nukers who thinks this is a dupe of the SMOKEY release, I\nsuggest that you read the TXD2K9 rules. They clearly state this:\nA release containing English subtitles after a foreign-tagged release\nis not considered a dupe, regardless of whether or not the foreign-tagged\nrelease has English subs.\n\nSome may think these releases are lame. But, tbh I don't give a damn.\nDanish movies that have english subs included, deserves to be spread\nto a wider audience. And I will keep doing this as long as other groups\nwon't include the subs eventhough they are on the DVD.\n\nThanks to the one who supplied the source.\nYou know who you are.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a897f3d0caefaf9a9c81736082c105168d4a0736","amp;dn":"Camping.2009.DVDRiP.XViD-RCDiVX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a897f3d0caefaf9a9c81736082c105168d4a0736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,151,243,208,202,239,175,154,156,129,115,96,130,193,5,22,141,74,7,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
