This book presents a novel infrastructure that provides a multi-channel broadcast framework for mobile users to effectively discover and access composite M-services. Multi-channel algorithms are proposed for efficiently accessing composite services.\n\nAccess to Mobile Services provides an in-depth survey of wireless data access and motivates the need to treat mobile services differently. A wireless adaptation of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is also covered.\n\nDesigned for researchers and practitioners who work in the general area of mobile services, this book is also suitable for advanced-level students in computer science.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b33d189e369acb713121abca1e2755cf9498948","amp;dn":"Access+to+Mobile+Services+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b33d189e369acb713121abca1e2755cf9498948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,51,209,137,227,105,172,183,19,18,26,188,161,226,117,92,249,73,137,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
