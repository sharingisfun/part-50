Only Corrie among her whole family survived to tell the story of how faith ultimately triumphs over evil. Here is the riveting account of how Corrie and her family were able to save many of God's chosen people.\n\nFor 35 years millions have seen that there is no pit so deep that God's love in not deeper still. Now The Hiding Place, repackaged for a new generation of readers, continue to declare that God's love will overcome, heal and restore.\n\nÃ‚Â©2009 Corrie Ten Boom; (P)2009 christianaudio.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af4c3902b61d09f3602794eb98e9f903a1a6269","amp;dn":"Ten+Boom%2C+Corrie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af4c3902b61d09f3602794eb98e9f903a1a6269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,244,195,144,43,97,208,159,54,2,121,78,185,142,159,144,58,26,98,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
