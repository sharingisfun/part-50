His partner? Colombia's Defense Department, who see One Laptop per Child as an investment in the region. (And you too can get involved.)\n\nA pioneer in the field of computer-aided design, Negroponte was perhaps best known for founding and directing MIT's Media Lab, which helped drive the multimedia revolution and now houses more than 500 researchers and staff. An original investor in WIRED (and the magazineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;patron saint&quot;), for five years he penned a column exploring the frontiers of technology -- ideas that he expanded into his 1995 best-selling book Being Digital. An angel investor extraordinaire, he's funded more than 40 startups, and served on the boards of companies such as Motorola and Ambient Devices.\n\nBut his latest effort, the One Laptop per Child project, may prove his most ambitious. The organization is manufacturing the XO (the &quot;$100 laptop&quot;), a wireless Internet-enabled, pedal-powered computer costing roughly $100. Negroponte hopes to put millions of these devices in the hands of the children in the developing world by 2010.\n\n    &quot;If Nicholas Negroponte can achieve his ambition of distributing $100 laptops to the world's disadvantaged children, he will help redefine philanthropy and see his name added to a list alongside the likes of Carnegie, Ford and Rockefeller.&quot;\n\nTechnology Review\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
