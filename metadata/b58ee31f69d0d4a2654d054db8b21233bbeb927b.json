I had found it awhile back and me and a lot of friends have found it really nice to use in school. Get on Myspace, FaceBook, Ebay, HERE... ahah \n\nAll you do is put on flashdrive &gt; put in computer run microsoft word.exe (haha) and then up pops a box and then you can minimize it to the system tray when it connects. It&amp;#039;s really nice\n\nThe reason it is called Microsoftword.exe is because for awhile we left it as the default, come to find out our school used a process searcher to find the origonal name and suspended two girls for being on myspace and having a proxy...\n\nHave fun and please seed o atleaste 2 ratios... this is a smalllll file haha\n\n\n[Maga]Zine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b58ee31f69d0d4a2654d054db8b21233bbeb927b","amp;dn":"Portable+Proxy+-+Bypass+School+Blocking+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b58ee31f69d0d4a2654d054db8b21233bbeb927b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,142,227,31,105,208,212,162,101,77,5,77,184,178,18,51,187,235,146,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
