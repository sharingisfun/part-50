Google has access to every keystroke you key ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ you read it right ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even before you hit enter. Not stopping at that, Google has the intention to retain the data, along with the Internet Protocol address (which is unique to each user to the point that it can be used to track you down to a specific location) that keyed it in.\nRegarding to Google, &quot;Google Chrome is a browser that combines a minimal design with sophisticated technology to make the web faster, safer, and easier&quot;. Unfortunately, each Google Chrome installation contains a unique ID that allowing identifying its user. Google doesn't make it an easy job to remove this ID.\n\nUnChrome helps you with this task. It replaces your unique ID with Null values so that your browser cannot be identified any longer. The functionality of Google Chrome is not influenced by this. You only need to apply UnChrome once. \n\nIf Google Chrome is started now then please close it. Afterwards, please click on the link below to anonymize your Chrome installation.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nEnjoy anonymous browsing using Google chrome without Google knowing that!!!!!\n\n===================================================================================\n\nUploaded by ---&gt;steve_1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:693f4b15bdfc66e1ec214ede710f13544e51568b","amp;dn":"Un-Crome.rar..Google+Spying%3F%3F---%3E%3Esteve_1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"693f4b15bdfc66e1ec214ede710f13544e51568b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,63,75,21,189,252,102,225,236,33,78,222,113,15,19,84,78,81,86,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
